  abstract = {Scenario-based model predictive control (MPC) methods introduce recourse into optimal control and can thus reduce the conservativeness inherent to open-loop robust MPC. However, the uncertainty scenarios are often generated offline using worst-case uncertainty bounds quantified a priori, limiting the potential gains in control performance. This paper presents a learning-based multistage MPC (msMPC) for systems with hard-to-model dynamics and time-varying plant-model mismatch. Gaussian Processes (GP) are used to learn state- and input-dependent plant-model mismatch in real-time and accordingly adapt the scenario tree online. Due to the increased computational complexity associated with incorporating the GP predictions into the optimal control problem, the learning-based msMPC (LB-msMPC) law is approximated by a deep neural network (DNN) that is cheap-to-evaluate online and has a small memory footprint, which makes it suitable for embedded applications. In addition, we present a novel algorithm for training the DNN-based controller that uses a GP description of the plant-model mismatch to generate closed-loop simulation data, which ensures the LB-msMPC law is evaluated in regions of the state space most relevant to closed-loop operation. The proposed LB-msMPC strategy is demonstrated on a cold atmospheric plasma jet with applications in (bio)materials processing. The simulation results indicate the promise of the approximate LB-msMPC strategy for control of hard-to-model systems with fast dynamics on millisecond timescales.},

  abstract = {Systematic design and verification of advanced control strategies for complex systems under uncertainty largely remains an open problem. Despite the promise of black-box optimization methods for automated controller tuning, they generally lack formal guarantees on the solution quality, which is especially important in the control of safety-critical systems. This letter focuses on obtaining closed-loop performance guarantees for automated controller tuning, which can be formulated as a black-box optimization problem under uncertainty. We use recent advances in non-convex scenario theory to provide a distribution-free bound on the probability of the closed-loop performance measures. To mitigate the computational complexity of the data-driven scenario optimization method, we restrict ourselves to a discrete set of candidate tuning parameters. We propose to generate these candidates using constrained Bayesian optimization run multiple times from different random seed points. We apply the proposed method for tuning an economic nonlinear model predictive controller for a semibatch reactor modeled by seven highly nonlinear differential equations.},

  abstract  = {While remote control over wireless connections is a key enabler for scalable control systems consisting of multiple actuator-sensor pairs, i.e., control systems, it entails two technical challenges. Due to the lack of wireless resources, only a limited number of control systems can be served, making the state observations outdated. Further, even after scheduling, the state observations received through wireless channels are distorted, hampering control stability. To address these issues, in this article we propose a scheduling algorithm that reduces the age-of-information (AoI) of the last received states. Meanwhile, for non-scheduled sensor-actuator pairs, we propose a machine learning (ML) aided predictive control algorithm, in which states are predicted using a Gaussian process regression (GPR). Since the GPR prediction credibility decreases with the AoI of the input data, both predictive control and AoI-based scheduler should be co-designed. Hence, we formulate a joint scheduling and transmission power optimization via the Lyapunov optimization framework. Numerical simulations corroborate that the proposed co-designed predictive control and AoI based scheduling achieves lower control errors, compared to a benchmark scheme using a round-robin scheduler without state prediction.},

  abstract = {Summary This article presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) approach based on quasi-linear parameter varying (quasi-LPV) representations of the model and constraints. Stability of the proposed algorithm is ensured by the offline solution of an optimization problem with linear matrix inequality constraints in conjunction with an online terminal state constraint. Furthermore, an iterative approach is presented with which the NMPC optimization problem can be handled by solving a series of Quadratic Programs at each time step, this being highly computationally efficient. A practical and simple way of obtaining quasi-LPV representations of the system using velocity-based linearization is presented in two examples.},

  abstract = {Gaussian process (GP) regression has been widely used in supervised machine learning due to its flexibility and inherent ability to describe uncertainty in function estimation. In the context of control, it is seeing increasing use for modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems from data, as it allows the direct assessment of residual model uncertainty. We present a model predictive control (MPC) approach that integrates a nominal system with an additive nonlinear part of the dynamics modeled as a GP. We describe a principled way of formulating the chance-constrained MPC problem, which takes into account residual uncertainties provided by the GP model to enable cautious control. Using additional approximations for efficient computation, we finally demonstrate the approach in a simulation example, as well as in a hardware implementation for autonomous racing of remote-controlled race cars with fast sampling times of 20 ms, highlighting improvements with regard to both performance and safety over a nominal controller.},

  abstract = {Pulp is the most important raw material in paper industries, whose fiber length stochastic distribution (FLSD) shaping directly determines the energy consumption and paper quality of the subsequent papermaking processes. However, the mean and variance are insufficient to describe the FLSD shaping, which displays non-Gaussian distributional properties. Therefore, the traditional control method based on the mean and variance of the fiber length is difficult to control the FLSD shaping effectively. In this article, a novel data-driven predictive probability density function (PDF) control method is proposed for the FLSD shaping in the refining process. First, the PDF of FLSD shaping is approximated by a radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) and the parameters of each RBF basis function are tuned by using an iterative learning law. Second, the random vector functional link network (RVFLN)-based data-driven modeling method is employed to construct the prediction model of the weight vector. Consequently, the predictive controller is designed based on the constructed PDF model of the FLSD shaping in the refining process and the stability issue of the resulted closed-loop system is discussed. The experiments using industrial data are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners-Pulp quality control in the refining process plays a critical role in the optimization of product quality and energy saving in the pulping and papermaking processes. Different from the conventional control method based on the mean and variance of the fiber length, a novel data-driven predictive PDF control method is proposed for the non-Gaussian stochastic distribution dynamic characteristics of the fiber length, which is used to achieve the desired PDF shaping of fiber length distribution. This kind of novel control method includes the control of the traditional mean and variance of the fiber length in some sense and has applications that are more extensive.},

  abstract = {Surrogate modeling is a useful tool for enabling uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks that require many expensive model evaluations, as it replaces expensive high-fidelity models with cheap-to-evaluate surrogates. This paper investigates sparse polynomial chaos and Kriging methods for surrogate modeling of first-principles models with probabilistic uncertainty in parameters and initial conditions. The surrogate modeling methods are demonstrated on a 2-dimensional population balance (2D-PB) model for batch cooling crystallization of ibuprofen with 20 uncertain parameters. Our analysis indicates that not only sparse polynomial chaos expansions are powerful for probabilistic UQ, but also the approximation accuracy of Kriging surrogate models can be significantly improved when polynomial chaos expansions are used to describe their trend. A basis-adaptive least-angle-regression strategy is shown to be particularly useful for inducing sparsity in polynomial chaos expansions, allowing for dealing with problems with a relatively large number of uncertain inputs. The utility of sparse polynomial chaos- and Kriging-based surrogate models is illustrated for various forward and inverse UQ problems, including global sensitivity analysis as well as Bayesian and maximum a posteriori parameter estimation of the 2D-PB model, where massive savings in computational cost (up to 30,000-fold) are observed.},

Model predictive control allows for the direct or indirect control of forces, while taking constraints into account. However, challenges arise when the robot environment that affects the force is highly variable, uncertain and difficult to model. Learning supported model predictive control makes it possible to combine the advantages of optimal control, such as the explicit consideration of constraints, with the advantages of machine learning, such as adaptive data-based modeling. In this paper Gaussian processes are used to model the contact forces that are applied in model predictive force control. The Gaussian process learns the static output mapping describing the interaction of the robot with the environment. It is shown that stability guarantees can be derived in a similar way as in classical predictive control. A proof-of-concept experimental implementation of a direct hybrid position force controller for a lightweight robot shows real-time feasibility.},

This paper presents a general internal model control (IMC) structure with multiple degrees-of-freedom for the design of control systems with multiple objectives (i.e., reference tracking and load and output disturbance rejection), so that controllers are designed independently of each other. The optimal performance of controllers is shown to remain intact when a controller is taken off-line, for example, due to actuator and/or sensor failures. This feature circumvents the need to redesign the remaining on-line controllers for optimal failure-tolerant control. The proposed control approach is used to derive IMC control structures for multi-loop cascade and coordinated control systems. The performance of the control approach is demonstrated on a simulated thin-film drying process in continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing for several multi-loop control structures and a variety of control-loop component failures.},

We look to address this problem by approximating the implicitly-defined MPC controller using deep learning. Although the resulting neural network approximation has a small memory footprint and can be efficiently computed, it does not guarantee robust constraint satisfaction or stability. We propose a novel projection-based strategy that is capable of providing a certificate of robust feasibility and input-to-state stability in real-time.

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method to compute an upper bound on the induced L2-gain for a linear parameter varying (LPV) system with rational parameter dependence. The proposed method relies on a standard dissipation inequality condition. The storage function is a quadratic function of the state and a rational function of the parameters. The specific parameter dependence is restricted to involve (fixed) rational functions and an affine term with free decision variables. Finsler’s lemma and affine annihilators are used to formulate sufficient linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions for the dissipativity relation. The dimension and conservatism of the resulting LMI problem are reduced by the joint application of minimal generators and maximal annihilators. An LPV model of a pendulum–cart system is used to demonstrate the proposed method and compare it to existing techniques in the literature.},

Although the technique is widely known, its utilization for finite-time control problems is still considered to be new since finite-time passivity has been just recently introduced. The proposed scheme consists of few design steps. First, a feedback is designed such that it yields finite-time stability for the zero-dynamics of the synchronization errors. Then, the synchronization errors is transformed into a finite-time passive system by an additional feedback. Consequently, the finite-time convergence of the synchronization errors is obtained. The hyperchaotic Lü system and a 5D Lorenz-like system are used as examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme.},

  abstract = {We develop a novel data-driven robust model predictive control (DDRMPC) approach for automatic control of irrigation systems. The fundamental idea is to integrate both mechanistic models, which describe dynamics in soil moisture variations, and data-driven models, which characterize uncertainty in forecast errors of evapotranspiration and precipitation, into a holistic systems control framework. To better capture the support of uncertainty distribution, we take a new learning-based approach by constructing uncertainty sets from historical data. For the evapotranspiration forecast error, the support vector clustering-based uncertainty set is adopted, which can be conveniently built from historical data. As for precipitation forecast errors, we analyze the dependence of their distribution on forecast values, and further design a tailored uncertainty set based on the properties of this type of uncertainty. In this way, the overall uncertainty distribution can be elaborately described, which finally contributes to rational and efficient control decisions. To assure the quality of data-driven uncertainty sets, a training-calibration scheme is used to provide theoretical performance guarantees. A generalized affine decision rule is adopted to obtain tractable approximations of optimal control problems, thereby ensuring the practicability of DDRMPC. Case studies using real data show that DDRMPC can reliably maintain soil moisture above the safety level and avoid crop devastation. The proposed DDRMPC approach leads to a 40% reduction of total water consumption compared to the fine-tuned open-loop control strategy. In comparison with the carefully tuned rule-based control and certainty equivalent MPC, the proposed DDRMPC approach can significantly reduce the total water consumption and improve the control performance.},

Some interesting new features such as highly improved interoperability with other packages, automatic extraction of the ultraviolet divergent parts of 1-loop integrals, support for amplitudes with Majorana fermions and γ-matrices with explicit Dirac indices are explained in detail. Furthermore, we discuss some common problems and misunderstandings that may arise in the daily usage of the package, providing explanations and workarounds.
Program summary
Program Title: FeynCalc CPC Library link to program files: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/cmpjr5ktmp.2 Licensing provisions: GNU GPLv3 Programming language: Wolfram Mathematica 8 and higher External routines/libraries: FeynArts [1] Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Commun., 207, 432–444, (2016). Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Symbolic calculation of Feynman diagrams in particle physics and suitable standalone expressions in Quantum Field Theory. Solution method: The required algorithms and algebraic identities are implemented in Wolfram Mathematica. Reasons for the new version: Highly improved interoperability with other packages, new routines for Dirac algebra and loop integral evaluation. Summary of revisions: FeynCalc can be loaded with arbitrary packages into the same Mathematica kernel without causing shadowing issues. Algebraic manipulations of Dirac matrices and spinors with explicit Dirac indices are now available. Amplitudes involving Majorana fermions (both written by hand or obtained with FeynArts [1] can be evaluated out-of-the box. The same goes for FeynArts-generated diagrams with 4-fermion operators. The algorithm of [2] is added to extract UV-poles from scalar 1-loop integrals (Passarino–Veltman functions) with an arbitrary number of external legs. Restrictions: In the case of multi-particle (beyond 1→3 and 2→3) or multiloop processes, it is not advisable to perform all algebraic evaluations only with FeynCalc and Mathematica. References [1] T.

This paper proposes a deep Gaussian process algorithm for lithium-ion battery health monitoring. The proposed algorithm uses Gaussian processes to model mapping between the layers, and matrix-variate Gaussian distribution to model correlation between nodes of a given layer. Deep architecture of the proposed algorithm enables capacity estimation using the partial charge-discharge time-series data, in the form of voltage, temperature and current, eliminating need for input feature extraction. The algorithm also estimates statistical correlation between capacity and the elapsed time from the first cycle, which enables end of life prediction. Hidden layer output of the proposed algorithm correlates strongly with the battery internal states, enabling on-board diagnosis of battery degradation mechanisms. The paper demonstrates effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using aging dataset of batteries cycled at different C-rates, temperatures and usage profiles. The proposed algorithm predicts capacity and end of life with coefficient of determinant greater than 0.9 and mean absolute error less than 0.1, demonstrating high prediction accuracy of the proposed approach. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Most of the existing approaches separate learning, i.e., the system identification based on a fixed dataset, and control, i.e., the execution of the model-based control law. This separation makes the performance highly sensitive to the initial selection of training data and possibly requires very large datasets. This article proposes a learning feedback linearizing control law using online closed-loop identification. The employed Gaussian process model updates its training data only if the model uncertainty becomes too large. This event-triggered online learning ensures high data efficiency and thereby reduces computational complexity, which is a major barrier for using Gaussian processes under real-time constraints. We propose safe forgetting strategies of data points to adhere to budget constraints and to further increase data efficiency. We show asymptotic stability for the tracking error under the proposed event-triggering law and illustrate the effective identification and control in simulation. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

The study we present here is significant in that it addresses the problem of efficiently controlling general stochastic epidemic systems without relying on mean-field approximation, which is an important issue in the theory of stochastic epidemic processes. This enables us to provide rigorous convergence guarantees on the stochastic epidemic model itself, improving over the mean-field type convergence results of most prior work. There are two primary technical difficulties addressed in treating this problem: 1) constructing a means of tractably approximating the evolution of the process so that the designed approximation is robust to the modeling error introduced by the applied moment closure and 2) guaranteeing that the designed controller causes the closed-loop system to drive the SEIV process to extinction quickly. As an application, we use the developed framework for optimizing the use of quarantines in containing an SEIV epidemic outbreak.},

It then calculates the compensation signal using a constrained model predictive control algorithm and adds it to the original reference position as the new system input. Experiments were conducted on an X-Y table to compare the proposed method with a traditional cascaded proportional-integral (PI) controller and two existing contouring error precompensation methods.

Moreover, the dwell time-dependent asynchronous passive controllers are formulated simultaneously. It has been shown that the derived results are also applicable to the studies of passivity and synchronous feedback passification for discrete-time switched systems under the combined switching strategy.

Firstly, the first principle model of a quadruple tank system is established derived by physical law and taken as a benchmark. Then the brief control block diagram is presented. Secondly, the Gaussian process model is introduced. As a non-parametric probabilistic model, it has a solid theoretic and inference basis to be combined with the model predictive control. One-step prediction and multi-step prediction are inferred as a basis of control. Thirdly, GP-MPC combines the offline identification of GP and the online optimization of MPC. Furthermore, the local linearization based on GP is proposed to promote the algorithm by converting the nonlinear optimization to a quadratic programming problem with less time and better performance. Finally, simulations are executed on the quadruple tank system to compare the GP-MPC algorithm and the one with local linearization.},

The novelty of the model is that the functional response simulates group defense of the prey kind, which in turn, affects permanency of the system and existence of limit cycles. We show that permanency of the system holds automatically for some values of parameters and provides sufficient conditions for global stability of interior equilibrium by constructing a Lyapunov function. We prove that for some values of parameters the system exhibits a Hopf cycle and provides conditions by which the corresponding stable Hopf cycle is the only cycle that model may have. Numerical simulations show that if the conditions are broken, the model may have more than one limit cycle, which is phenomenal among the predator–prey models with one interior equilibrium.},

  abstract  = {Model predictive control is a successful method of regulating the operation of constrained dynamical systems. However, its applicability is limited by the necessity of solving in real-time an optimization problem. Explicit model predictive control techniques aim to precompute the optimal control law off-line for all feasible points in the state space of the system. However, constructing the explicit control law off-line and using it to compute the control inputs on-line can be computationally demanding for medium to large scale systems. Hence, several approaches have been suggested to approximate the explicit control law. This paper proposes the use of Gaussian processes for this purpose. Gaussian processes allow one to define a systematic way of selecting these training data which minimize the uncertainty of the approximation. Unlike other approaches in the literature, domain specific knowledge is exploited here to simplify the training effort, while probabilistic guarantees are provided for the proximity of the derived approximation to the explicit control law. We illustrate, in a number of benchmark systems, the efficacy of the proposed approach which leads to closed-loop operation similar to that of the exact explicit control law, only at a fraction of the computation effort.},

A simple constraint-tightening method based on the exponential decay rate of a δ-Lyapunov function is extended to the stochastic setting. This method uses the notion of incremental stabilizability to alleviate the need for offline, but involved computation of terminal constraints. The proposed method is compared to a SNMPC formulation that employs terminal constraints and Lipschitz constant-based constraint tightening. A comparative analysis is presented on a benchmark continuous stirred-tank reactor problem. Practical approximations for computing terminal sets are discussed in the context of this comparison.},

While industrial robots address this through stiffness and high-performance hardware, compliant and cost-effective robots require advanced control to achieve accurate position tracking. In this letter, we present a model-based control approach, which makes use of data gathered during operation to improve the model of the robotic arm and thereby the tracking performance. The proposed scheme is based on an inverse dynamics feedback linearization and a data-driven error model, which are integrated into a model predictive control formulation. In particular, we show how offset-free tracking can be achieved by augmenting a nominal model with both a Gaussian process, which makes use of offline data, and an additive disturbance model suitable for efficient online estimation of the residual disturbance via an extended Kalman filter. The performance of the proposed offset-free GPMPC scheme is demonstrated on a compliant 6 degrees of freedom robotic arm, showing significant performance improvements compared to other robot control algorithms.},

  abstract        = {Recasting the rate equations of mass-action chemical kinetics into universal formats is a potentially useful strategy to rationalize typical features that are observed in the space of the species concentrations. For example, a remarkable feature is the appearance of the so-called slow manifolds (subregions of the concentration space where the trajectories bundle), whose detection can be exploited to simplify the description of the slow part of the kinetics via model reduction and to understand how the chemical network approaches the stationary state. Here we focus on generally open chemical reaction networks with continuous injection of species at constant rates, that is, the situation of idealized biochemical networks and microreactors under well-mixing conditions and externally controllable input of chemicals. We show that a unique format of pure quadratic ordinary differential equations can be achieved, regardless of the nonlinearity of the kinetic scheme, by means of a suitable change and extension of the set of dynamical variables. Then we outline some possible employments of such a format, with special emphasis on a low-computational-cost strategy to localize the slow manifolds which are indeed observed also for open systems. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Firstly, the passivity condition enabling system exponentially stable is presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Secondly, a singular perturbation parameter ε-dependent disturbance observer is constructed, and the estimate is incorporated in the design of the adaptive ISMC with the reachability condition guaranteed. Then, a set of LMIs are obtained to determine the controller gain of the ISMC, and an ε-bound estimation approach is derived, such that the closed-loop SPSs are passive and exponentially stable. Compared with the existing results, the proposed approaches have less conservatism because of adopting a more general storage function, which leads to a superior transient performance and a bigger ε-bound. Finally, the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated by three examples.},

Conventional architecture consists of multiple sensors, which work collaboratively to sense the units on road to yield a precise and safe driving strategy. Besides the precision and safety, the quickness of decision is also a major concern. In order to react quickly, the vehicle need to predict its next possible action, such as acceleration, brake and steering angle, according to its latest few actions and status. In this paper, we treat this decision-making problem as a regression problem and use deep gaussian process to predict its next action. The regression model is trained using simulation data sets and accurately captures the most significant features. Combined with rule-based method, it can be used in Torcs simulation engine to realize successful loop trip on virtual roads. The proposed method outperforms the existing reinforcement learning methods on the performance indicators of time consumption and the size of data volume. It may be useful for real road tests in the future. © 2019 IEEE.},

However, guaranteeing correct operation during the learning process is currently an unresolved issue, which is of vital importance in safety-critical systems. We propose a general safety framework based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability methods that can work in conjunction with an arbitrary learning algorithm. The method exploits approximate knowledge of the system dynamics to guarantee constraint satisfaction while minimally interfering with the learning process. We further introduce a Bayesian mechanism that refines the safety analysis as the system acquires new evidence, reducing initial conservativeness when appropriate while strengthening guarantees through real-time validation. The result is a least-restrictive, safety-preserving control law that intervenes only when the computed safety guarantees require it, or confidence in the computed guarantees decays in light of new observations. We prove theoretical safety guarantees combining probabilistic and worst-case analysis and demonstrate the proposed framework experimentally on a quadrotor vehicle. Even though safety analysis is based on a simple point-mass model, the quadrotor successfully arrives at a suitable controller by policy-gradient reinforcement learning without ever crashing, and safely retracts away from a strong external disturbance introduced during flight.},

   generation of stable oscillations in a class of uncertain nonlinear
   systems with both matched and unmatched uncertainties. For this purpose,
   first, the modified Lyapunov function is introduced which is appropriate
   for stability analysis of invariant sets (instead of equilibrium
   points). The structure of the proposed Lyapunov function is related to
   the shape of the desirable limit cycle. Next, in order to design the
   robust limit cycle control input, the backstepping and Lyapunov redesign
   methods are employed, simultaneously. The The classical Lyapunov
   redesign controller is discontinuous and robust with respect to matched
   uncertainties. To overcome unmatched uncertainties, a modified version
   of the Lyapunov redesign controller is suggested in each step of
   backstepping which results in a continuous robust control law.
   Furthermore, the convergence of the phase trajectories of the uncertain
   closed-loop system to the target limit cycle is proved using the
   extended Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, computer simulations are
   performed to show the applicability of the given approach. In this
   regard, two uncertain nonlinear practical systems are considered and
   robust stable oscillations are generated in these systems via the
   proposed controller. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the
   proposed technique.}},

For this purpose, the effects of changes in stiffness, mass matrix and different lift distributions between jig and 1g trimmed cruise condition are analyzed with regard to the flutter prediction according to the p-k method. The structural and aerodynamic effects are exemplary compared using a generic composite higher aspect ratio swept wing, where the most significant influence could be identified by the simple geometrical change from jig- to flight-shape.},

Furthermore, we enhance the controller with a new kernel function for the Gaussian Process and deal with noisy measurements, as well as, the noisy training data for the Gaussian Process, arising therefrom. This enables us to move the proposed control algorithm, a combination of Model Predictive Controller and a Gaussian Process, closer towards clinical application.

  abstract = {This paper presents a stochastic-tube model predictive control (MPC) strategy that systematically handles plant-model mismatch, guarantees stability in the presence of changing operating conditions, and ensures offset-free tracking for all reachable operating conditions. The key notion of this work is to separate the system uncertainty into two distinct sources of additive bounded state error. The first source is a non-random uncertainty that represents mismatch between the linear model of the controller and the true plant (as well as other types of persistent disturbances). The second source represents random fluctuations due to either the intrinsic stochastic variability of the system, or exogenous disturbances. Recursive feasibility and stability of the stochastic-tube MPC strategy is guaranteed by defining the terminal invariant set to include the effect of changes in the steady-state operating conditions. Offset-free tracking is achieved with a disturbance estimator that can be tuned independently of the controller. To reduce the conservatism inherent to robust control performance, a new filter model for deterministic disturbances is proposed that predicts uncertainty in the future evolution of the disturbances based on a bound on how quickly the plant-model mismatch can vary. The stochastic-tube MPC strategy is demonstrated on two simulation case studies—a benchmark DC-DC converter and an industrially-motivated fluidized-bed catalytic cracking unit.},

Furthermore, an optimization-based systematic passivity analysis procedure and a passivating output projection are proposed for asymptotically stable rational LPV systems in the linear fractional representation (LFR) form having at least as many independent output signals as input signals. The storage function is searched in a quadratic form with a symmetric rational parameter-dependent matrix. In order to form a square system and then to satisfy the Kalman-Yakubovich- Popov (KYP) properties, a parameter-dependent output projection matrix is searched in the LFR form. The nonlinear parameter dependence from the linear matrix inequality (LMI) and equality (LME) conditions provided by the KYP lemma is factorized out using the linear fractional transformation (LFT). Then, Finsler's lemma and affine annihilators are used to relax the sufficient affine parameter-dependent LMI and LME conditions. As an application example, a stable system inversion is addressed and demonstrated on a benchmark rational LPV model.},

The presented method is a discrete-time extension of the approach first presented in ([18]), where the authors used Finsler{\textquoteright}s lemma and affine annihilators to give sufficient LMI conditions for stability. The system representation required for DOA computation is generated systematically by using the linear fractional transformation (LFT). Then a model simplification step not affecting the computed {Lyapunov} function (LF) is executed on the obtained linear fractional representation (LFR). The LF is computed in a general quadratic form of a state and parameter dependent vector of rational functions, which are generated from the obtained LFR model. The proposed method is compared to the numeric n-dimensional order reduction technique proposed in ([35]). Finally, additional tuning knobs are proposed to obtain more degrees of freedom in the LMI conditions. The method is illustrated on two benchmark examples.},

  abstract = {Limit cycles occur in a wide range of nonlinear and hybrid systems including dynamic walking. While methods for determining local stability of limit cycles are available, they are relevant only for small perturbations. Characterizing the robustness of limit cycles to larger perturbations is an important, yet mostly open, challenge. Robustness can be characterized by the basin of attraction (BA), but standard techniques for computing BAs are computationally intensive. Here we present an algorithm to estimate inner bounds of BAs of fixed points of polynomial discrete maps. The algorithm is based on a convex optimization problem known as Sum of Squares programming, and results in BA estimates which are expressed as sublevel sets of polynomial Lyapunov functions. The method can be applied to estimate BAs of fixed points of discrete Poincaré Maps and thus the BAs of limit cycles on selected Poincaré sections, as demonstrated on a simple biped walking model under different modes of actuation. For each mode of actuation, the Poincaré map was fitted using a small number of simulations and an inner bound for the BA was estimated. Comparing the BAs achieved by the different modes of actuation demonstrates that the BA of a passive biped model can be enlarged using minimalistic event-driven actuation, and that this relationship is also apparent from the estimated inner bounds of the BAs.},

Considering that the effective sensing range of onboard sensors is practically short, we integrate the path planning into model predictive path following control (MPFC) with sigmoid-based path template which can be easily revised when the new obstacles information is within the detection range. We leverage the framework of model predictive contouring control (MPCC) to suit high speed path following control applications. The MPFC structure allows for input and state constraints for the specific practical scene. The trade-off between contouring accuracy and traversal time is addressed using the MPFC cost function, allowing the system to deviate from the desired path in order to make the path be traversed faster and whereas sacrificing path speed (traversal time) in order to increase safety. The weights in the cost function determine the relative importance of the competing control objectives. In case of traversal, we build a virtual safety corridor in the horizon for quadrotors, which facilitates the control scheme to be extended to incorporate obstacle avoidance by adjusting the constraints and thus re-plan its traversal path. The control performance is investigated experimentally using a realistic dynamics model of DJI M100 platform. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.},

  abstract      = {This paper proposes a generic tool named Hybrid Bond Graph (HBG) driven by an automaton. Along with the conventional Bond Graph (BG) properties, the proposed approach offers some very valuable advantages in modelling the Hybrid Dynamical Systems (HDS). It allows having one global model of all the distinct dynamics called dynamical operating modes generated due to the hybrid aspect of the system. Compared with other classical approaches such as the hybrid automata, the Operating Mode Management (OMM) is much simpler and more effective thanks to the separation between the continuous dynamics associated with the BG continuous state and the discrete state governed by a separate classical automaton. From the diagnosis point of view, the approach allows to obtain one global graphical robust diagnoser simply derived from the model using the Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT). Using the BG causal properties along with the correspondences between the system components and the BG elements, the Event-Driven Hybrid Bond Graph (EDHBG) also helps to associate between the faults and their suspected components. The innovative interest in this work is that it allows for a non-expert user to perform the modelling, the on-line robust diagnosis and the OMM, without expressing the algebraic equations of the system and regardless of its hybrid aspect. A pedagogic experimental set-up serving as a comprehensive example is implemented on 20Sim1 to demonstrate the potential of this technique. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Often, however, uncertainties are present, which can lead to lower performance and constraint violations. In this paper, an approach is proposed that incorporates the square root Unscented Kalman filter directly into the optimal control problem to estimate the states and to propagate the mean and covariance of the states to consider noise from disturbances, parametric uncertainties and state estimation errors. The covariance is propagated up to a predefined “robust horizon” to limit open-loop covariances, and chance constraints are introduced to maintain feasibility. Often variables in chemical engineering are non-negative, which however can be violated by the Unscented Kalman filter leading to erroneous predictions. This problem is solved by log-transforming these variables to ensure consistency. The approach was verified and compared to a nominal nonlinear model predictive control algorithm on a semi-batch reactor case study with an economic objective via Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract  = {Model predictive control is a popular control approach for multivariable systems with important process constraints. The presence of significant stochastic uncertainties can however lead to closed-loop performance and infeasibility issues. A remedy is given by stochastic model predictive control, which exploits the probability distributions of the uncertainties to formulate probabilistic constraints and objectives. For nonlinear systems the difficulty of propagating stochastic uncertainties is a major obstacle for online implementations. In this paper we propose to use Gaussian processes to obtain a tractable framework for handling nonlinear optimal control problems with Gaussian parametric uncertainties. It is shown how this technique can be used to formulate nonlinear chance constraints. The method is verified by showing the ability of the Gaussian process to accurately approximate the probability density function of the underlying system and by the closed-loop behaviour of the algorithm via Monte Carlo simulations on an economic batch reactor case study.},

The main idea to solve the stabilization problem lies in the use of the S-procedure Lemma. Such problem is then transformed into a solving problem of Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMIs). Through the Schur complement Lemma and the Matrix Inversion Lemma, a linearization procedure is employed to transform the BMIs into LMIs. Some improvements and comparisons with other LMI-based design techniques without state constraints are developed and discussed. An extensive portfolio of numerical studies is presented. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed feedback controller toward uncertainties in the friction parameters and external disturbances are illustrated through simulation results.},

In the case of quasi-monotonicity, the existence and comparison theorems for the solutions to the initial value problems of the systems were first established on R with the analytic semigroup theory and the abstract functional differential equations. Then based on the weighted energy method, the comparison theorem as well as the embedding theorem, the global exponential stability of the monostable large-speed traveling wave solutions under the so-called large initial perturbation (i. e. the initial perturbation around the traveling wave decaying exponentially as % -• - oo, but being arbitrarily large at other locations) was obtained for the systems in the weighted Sobolev space. The results show that, as the steady state solution of the system, the traveling wave solution usually determines the long-term asymptotic behavior of the solution to the initial value problem. Its stability reveals that the phenomena and results of inter-species competition systems can be clearly observed without interference by external factors. © 2018 Editorial Office of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics.

Racing dynamics are notoriously hard to model from first principles, which is addressed by means of a cautious nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) approach that learns to improve its dynamics model from data and safely increases racing performance. The approach makes use of a Gaussian Process (GP) and takes residual model uncertainty into account through a chance constrained formulation. We present a sparse GP approximation with dynamically adjusting inducing inputs, enabling a real-time implementable controller. The formulation is demonstrated in simulations, which show significant improvement with respect to both lap time and constraint satisfaction compared to an NMPC without model learning.},

Structural properties of Bond graphs in Linear Fractional transformation (BG-LFT) are exploited to model interval-valued uncertainties over a BG model in order to form an uncertain BG. The inherent causal properties are exploited to generate interval-valued fault indicators. Then, various properties of IA are used to generate point valued residual and interval-valued thresholds. The latter must contain the point valued residuals under nominal system functioning. A systematic procedure is proposed for passive-type fault detection method which is robust to uncertain system parameters and measurements. The viability of the method is shown through experimental study of a steam generator system. The limitations associated with existing fault detection method based on BG-LFT are alleviated by the proposed approach. Moreover, it is shown that proposed approach generalizes the BG-LFT method. This work forms the initial step towards integrating interval analysis based capabilities in BG framework for fault detection and health monitoring of uncertain systems. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Then, in order to guarantee stability (in the sense of finite L2-gain) of the feedback interconnection of the system with an arbitrary nonlinear output strictly passive system, the given system must itself be output strictly passive. The proof is based on the S-procedure lossless theorem. We discuss the importance of this result for the control of systems interacting with an output strictly passive, but otherwise completely unknown, environment. Similarly, we prove the necessity of the small-gain condition for closed-loop stability of certain time-varying systems, extending the well-known necessity result in linear robust control.},

However, these methods typically do not provide any safety guarantees, which prevents their use in safety-critical, real-world applications. In this paper, we present a learning-based model predictive control scheme that can provide provable high-probability safety guarantees. To this end, we exploit regularity assumptions on the dynamics in terms of a Gaussian process prior to construct provably accurate confidence intervals on predicted trajectories. Unlike previous approaches, we do not assume that model uncertainties are independent. Based on these predictions, we guarantee that trajectories satisfy safety constraints. Moreover, we use a terminal set constraint to recursively guarantee the existence of safe control actions at every iteration. In our experiments, we show that the resulting algorithm can be used to safely and efficiently explore and learn about dynamic systems.},

  abstract = {The terminal cost and terminal set method for guaranteeing stability of nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) closed–loop systems is theoretically appealing but often impractical. This is due to the difficulty of computing invariant sets and control Lyapunov functions for general nonlinear systems. In this paper we propose a novel method for computing time–varying terminal costs and sets by means of first order or second order Taylor approximations of the nonlinear system dynamics. The method first solves a set of linear matrix inequalities to compute the terminal ingredients for the approximated dynamics. Then, a small scale global nonlinear optimization problem is solved to check the validity of the terminal ingredients for the nonlinear dynamics. The proposed method also allows for time–varying linear or nonlinear terminal control laws. The developed method can result in significant enlargements of the domain of attraction of the nonlinear MPC closed–loop system, as demonstrated by a benchmark academic example.},

The microgrid consists of a photovoltaic (PV) panel and a battery energy storage system, which are connected to a power grid and a local load via a dc bus. At each sampling time, the predictions for PV output power and load demand power are calculated, and an MPC algorithm is executed based on these predictions and a physical battery model to decide the set point of the battery. Simulations of two case studies, namely, a labscale microgrid and a commercial microgrid, are presented. We compare the performance of MPC with various horizon lengths to a rule-based control strategy to demonstrate a cost reduction of more than 2%.},

It is assumed that the system matrices are affine functions of uncertain bounded parameters with bounded variations. Firstly, a novel version of the Bound Real Lemma for linear discrete time varying descriptor systems is presented. Then, the latter result is specialized for state-feedback design in terms of linear matrix inequality constraints in order to ensure the closed-loop admissibility while guaranteeing an upper-bound on the system H2-norm for all admissible uncertainty. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed control design technique.}},

The uncertain system is given as a connection of a nominal linear time-invariant system and a perturbation. The input/output behavior of the perturbation is described by integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). The proposed approach incorporates IQCs into a dissipation inequality formulation. One issue is that it is often useful to specify the IQC in the frequency domain or, equivalently, in the time-domain as a “soft” infinite-horizon constraint. However, the dissipation inequality formulation requires constraints that are valid over all finite time horizons. The main technical result is a finite-horizon bound on soft IQCs constructed using a state-feedback transformation. This forms the basis for the proposed iterative algorithm to estimate invariant sets. A simple example is provided to demonstrate the proposed approach.},

  abstract      = {Controlling a complex nonlinear system has always been an important problem. A neuro fuzzy controller may be an appropriate controller for such systems. There have been always problems with large number of neurons which cause heavy complex computations in neuro fuzzy controllers. In this paper, a variable structure neuro fuzzy controller is introduced to prevent number of neurons from rising. The proposed variable structure controller, adapts itself on-line to the system. Therefore, because of the adaptive structure, there is no need to have a large number of neurons. As a result, calculations and controller complexity will decrease in this structure. The proposed controller also uses an improved gradient descent method to update different varying parameters. In this improved method, adaptive learning rates are used to prevent parameters getting stuck in local optima. Improved gradient descent method also takes the advantages of {Lyapunov} stability method in updating the parameters. The use of {Lyapunov} method in updating the network parameters will guarantee the stability of the controller, too. A complex nonlinear time delay system is introduced in this paper to evaluate the proposed variable structure fuzzy wavelet neural network controller. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of this new controller. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

While for LTI systems the problem can be efficiently handled, for LPV systems is not available a single algorithm that would provide the desired annihilator. Thus alternative solutions are needed to handle the cases that might appear in applications. This paper provides new insights and additional technical details for the authors’ previously proposed inversion based technique. As an alternative, for a special class of LPV systems where the parameter variation is affine, this paper provides an extension of the LTI techniques that computes the annihilator based on the geometric framework. A comparison of the two approaches gives an opportunity to illustrate some of the intricacies of the LPV modeling.},

Upper bounds on time averages can be proved a priori using auxiliary functions, the optimal choice of which is a convex optimization problem. We prove that the problems of finding maximal trajectories and minimal auxiliary functions are strongly dual. Thus, auxiliary functions provide arbitrarily sharp upper bounds on time averages. Moreover, any nearly minimal auxiliary function provides phase space volumes in which all nearly maximal trajectories are guaranteed to lie. For polynomial equations, auxiliary functions can be constructed by semidefinite programming, which we illustrate using the Lorenz system.},

It is shown that parameter-varying decoupling makes it possible to use SISO LTI control design to address all degrees of motion freedom subject to high-speed maneuvers that require large pitch and roll angles. Specifically a decoupling method based on local linearizations (gain-scheduling decoupling) is compared to a global scheduling-dependent decoupling method inspired by computed-torque control, where the scheduling is based on the tilt angels of the drone. Based on an extensive simulation study, it is demonstrated that such a relatively simple control architecture can achieve significantly better performance than LTI control. Conceptually, the presented techniques can be used for the design of control schemes for aircraft and missiles.},

As a result, the distributed consensus problem can be decomposed into H$\infty$ stabilization subproblems for a set of independent linear fractional transformation (LFT) systems, whose dimensions are equal to that of a single agent plant plus the associated local IQC dynamics. New delay control synthesis conditions for each subproblem are fully characterized as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A numerical example is used to demonstrate the proposed approach.

According to the latter issue and regarding to other properties, it is shown that ALF is a Maximal {Lyapunov} Function. To this end, a numerical method to approximate the ALF as a polynomial function is proposed. To ensure that the approximated function has positive value and negative derivative inside the desired region, the homotopy continuation method is used.

  abstract = {Recently a method was presented to compute Lyapunov functions for nonlinear systems with multiple local attractors [5]. This method was shown to succeed in delivering algorithmically a Lyapunov function giving qualitative information on the system’s dynamics, including lower bounds on the attractors’ basins of attraction. We suggest a simpler and faster algorithm to compute such a Lyapunov function if the attractors in question are exponentially stable equilibrium points. Just as in [5] one can apply the algorithm and expect to obtain partial information on the system dynamics if the assumptions on the system at hand are only partially fulfilled. We give four examples of our method applied to different dynamical systems from the literature.},

It is shown that a sufficient condition for determining such controllers can be obtained by solving convex optimization problems with linear matrix inequality constraints through the introduction of a Lyapunov function depending polynomially on both uncertainty and controller. The proposed condition is also necessary for sufficiently large degrees of the polynomials involved under some assumptions.},

Using a prior known relation between outputs, joint auto- and cross-covariance functions can be constructed. Realizations from these joint-covariance functions give outputs that are consistent with the prior relation. One issue with gaussian process regression is efficient inference when scaling upto large datasets. In this paper we use approximate inference techniques upon multi-output kernels enforcing relationships between outputs. Results of the proposed methodology for theoretical data and real world applications are presented. The main contribution of this paper is the application and validation of our methodology on a dataset of real aircraft flight tests, while imposing knowledge of aircraft physics into the model.},

Minimum error entropy with fiducial points (MEEF), as one of the ITL criteria, has not yet been well investigated in the literature. In this study, we suggest a new fixed-point MEEF (FP-MEEF) algorithm, and analyze its convergence based on Banach's theorem (contraction mapping theorem). Also, we discuss in detail the convergence rate of the proposed method, which is able to converge to the optimal solution quadratically with the appropriate selection of the kernel size. Numerical results confirm our theoretical analysis and also show the outperformance of FP-MEEF in comparison with FP-MSE in some non-Gaussian environments. In addition, the convergence rate of FP-MEEF and gradient descent-based MEEF is evaluated in some numerical examples.},

We give two procedures to construct a strongly stable coprime factorization for a strongly stabilizable and strongly detectable system. One of the procedures ensures the contractiveness of the resulting factorization. Then, we apply the structure-preserving balanced truncation method for distributed systems. We illustrate the proposed methods through an example.},

  abstract = {A key to achieve reliable model-based engine control, diagnostics and prognostics resides in in-flight engine model with high confidence level. Presented here is a new lifecycle real-time model to describe turbofan engine dynamic behavior called ALPVM (Adaptive Linear Parameter Varying Model), and the issues of engine/model mismatch compensation and performance degradation adaption are focused on. This methodology is different from the widely used STORM (Self Tuning On-board Real-time Model) presented by Pratt & Whitney, and the ALPVM is proposed on the linear parameter varying framework. The system matrices of ALPVM are computed using simultaneous step response data, and the polynomial LPV model is designed by the sets of polynomial fitting curves with scheduling parameters of engine operation in continuous forms. The IR-KELM (independent reduction kernel extreme learning machine) is developed to improve computational efforts without prediction accuracy reduction, and it serves an empirical model for polynomial LPV model mismatch compensation. The mechanisms of predict error control and linear dependency are considered in the IR-KELM, and it leads to decrease the hidden node number and simplify the IR-KELM topology. Kalman filter is employed to tune the health parameters of LPV model over its course of lifetime. Finally, the IR-KELM performance is confirmed by the benchmark data, and the simulation results from the ALPVM application to track a low-bypass turbofan engine dynamic behavior in the flight envelope indicate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach.},

This adds to the time-varying feature of the glucose metabolism process and places challenges on the blood glucose (BG) control of patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. This paper presents a Model Predictive Controller that takes the periodic IS into account, in order to enhance BG control. The future effect of the IS is predicted using a machine learning technique, namely, a customized Gaussian Process (GP), based on historical training data. The training data for the GP is continuously updated during closed-loop control, which enables the control scheme to learn and adapt to intra-individual and inter-individual changes of the circadian IS rhythm. The necessary state information is provided by an Unscented Kalman Filter. The closed-loop performance of the proposed control scheme is evaluated for different scenarios (including fasting, announced meals and skipped meals) through in silico studies on simulation models of Göttingen Minipigs.},

  abstract = {Summary This paper studies the issues of adaptive passification and global stabilization for a class of switched nonlinearly parameterized systems. Each subsystem is allowed to be non-feedback passive. Firstly, a passivity concept for switched nonlinear systems is proposed. In particular, the change of storage functions of an inactive subsystem is described. An adaptively feedback passive switched nonlinear system is shown to be stabilized under the partly asymptotic zero-state detectability assumption. Secondly, the adaptive feedback controller for each subsystem and a state-dependent switching law are designed to render the resulting closed-loop system passive. Finally, a new switched adaptive control technique is developed to solve the adaptive stabilization problem by exploiting the recursive feedback passification design technique and parameter separation technique when all subsystems have any same relative degree. The simulation results on adaptive stabilization of continuously stirred tank reactor system show effectiveness of the proposed design method. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {A passivating control architecture for SISO linear systems, comprising dynamic feedback and feedforward, is proposed. The approach - essentially without any restriction and by relying only on input/output measurements - provides a closed-loop system that is passive from a new control input to a modified output. The result is achieved by arbitrarily assigning the relative degree and the location of poles and zeros on the complex plane of the interconnected system in a systematic way. It is also shown that similar ideas can be employed to enforce a desired, arbitrarily small, L2-gain from an unknown disturbance input to a modified output, while preserving the corresponding gain from the control input to the same output. The paper is concluded with applications and further discussions on the results, which include constructions towards the adaptive control of non-minimum phase systems.},

Under a mild assumption on the high-frequency gain matrix and strongly minimum-phase assumption, a robust regulator is proposed with the combination of nonlinear internal model and a new extended high-gain observer. More explicitly, the robust output regulation is achieved by employing a novel extended high-gain observer-based stabilizer such that the regulated system, augmented with the nonlinear internal model, is asymptotically stabilized. The novelty of this approach consists in the use of an extended observer to estimate, under mild assumptions, all unmeasured terms. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract      = {Control theory can provide useful insights into the properties of controlled, dynamic systems. One important property of nonlinear systems is the region of attraction (ROA), a safe subset of the state space in which a given controller renders an equilibrium point asymptotically stable. The ROA is typically estimated based on a model of the system. However, since models are only an approximation of the real world, the resulting estimated safe region can contain states outside the ROA of the real system. This is not acceptable in safety-critical applications. In this paper, we consider an approach that learns the ROA from experiments on a real system, without ever leaving the true ROA and, thus, without risking safety-critical failures. Based on regularity assumptions on the model errors in terms of a Gaussian process prior, we use an underlying Lyapunov function in order to determine a region in which an equilibrium point is asymptotically stable with high probability. Moreover, we provide an algorithm to actively and safely explore the state space in order to expand the ROA estimate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in simulation.},

  abstract  = {This paper considers the problem of stability verification for discrete-time nonlinear systems via {Lyapunov} functions. Depending on the system dynamics, the candidate {Lyapunov} function and the set of initial states of interest, one generally needs to handle large, possibly non-convex or non-feasible optimization problems. To avoid such problems, we propose a constructive and systematically applicable sampling-based approach to stability analysis of nonlinear systems. This approach proposes verification of the decrease condition for a candidate {Lyapunov} function on a finite sampling of a bounded set of initial conditions and then it extends the validity of the {Lyapunov} function to an infinite set of initial conditions by exploiting continuity properties. This result involves no apriori analytic description of the continuity property and it is based on multi-resolution sampling, to perform efficient state-space exploration. Moreover, the stability verification is decentralized in the sampling points, which makes the method parallelizable. The proposed methodology is illustrated on two examples.},

Firstly, the first issue of modelling unknown dynamical motions is solved by using GP models based on sampled data. In this way, the model uncertainty can be numerically evaluated during modelling and prediction process. This is not easy when using other data-driven methods, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Fuzzy Models (FMs). Then a MPC scheme based on obtained GP models is proposed to address the second issue of designing appropriate quadrotor controllers. The proposed algorithm directly takes model uncertainty into account when planning MPC policies, and can be computationally efficiently implemented through using analytical gradients in the optimization process. The performance of quadrotor control using proposed approach is demonstrated by simulations on a trajectory tracking problem.},

The aforementioned indices measure the level of passivity of a system and we address the question of how to use this information to design a dynamic output feedback controller that stabilizes the closed-loop at a given equilibrium. As full state information is not always available for feedback, a measurable output has to be used. The main contribution of this paper consists of a systematic way of determining a stabilizing controller based on the passivity indices of the plant and on sum of squares (SOS) relaxations. A new method for determining the passivity indices of a nonlinear system in a domain of its state is presented as well. An example is provided in order to demonstrate the applicability of our strategy. Polynomial input-affine systems are considered.},

Polynomial input-affine systems were considered and sum of squares (SOS) techniques were employed for estimating a domain in which the passivity indices are valid and stability is guaranteed. Though simple and useful, the method still demands improvements, as the estimates obtained can be quite conservative. In this context, this work applies the Finsler's Lemma and the notion of linear annihilators for enlarging the estimates of the aforementioned regions of attraction by reformulating the estimation problem as a polytopic LMI condition. In addition, we extended the results of [2] for the class of the rational nonlinear systems with possibly rational Lyapunov functions.

  abstract = {In the past ten years many Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) algorithms have been developed for systems subject to stochastic disturbances and model uncertainties. These methods are motivated by many application fields where a-priori knowledge of the stochastic distribution of the uncertainties is available, some degree of constraint violation is allowed, and nominal operation should be defined as close as possible to the operational constraints for economic/optimality reasons. However, despite the large number of methods nowadays available, a general framework has not been proposed yet to classify the available alternatives. For these reasons, in this paper the main ideas underlying SMPC are first presented and different classifications of the available methods are proposed in terms of the dynamic characteristics of the system under control, the performance index to be minimized, the meaning and management of the probabilistic (chance) constraints adopted, and their feasibility and convergence properties. Focus is placed on methods developed for linear systems. In the first part of the paper, all these issues are considered, also with the help of a simple worked example. Then, in the second part, four algorithms representative of the most popular approaches to SMPC are briefly described and their main characteristics are discussed.},

  abstract = {Many controlled systems suffer from unmodeled nonlinear effects that recur periodically over time. Model-free controllers generally cannot compensate these effects, and good physical models for such periodic dynamics are challenging to construct. We investigate nonparametric system identification for periodically recurring nonlinear effects. Within a Gaussian process (GP) regression framework, we use a locally periodic covariance function to shape the hypothesis space, which allows for a structured extrapolation that is not possible with more widely used covariance functions. We show that hyperparameter estimation can be performed online using the maximum a posteriori point estimate, which provides an accuracy comparable with sampling methods as soon as enough data to cover the periodic structure has been collected. It is also shown how the periodic structure can be exploited in the hyperparameter optimization. The predictions obtained from the GP model are then used in a model predictive control framework to correct the external effect. The availability of good continuous predictions allows control at a higher rate than that of the measurements. We show that the proposed approach is particularly beneficial for sampling times that are smaller than, but of the same order of magnitude as, the period length of the external effect. In experiments on a physical system, an electrically actuated telescope mount, this approach achieves a reduction of about 20% in root mean square tracking error.},

Firstly, the integration unknown input observer is designed for the more widely left invertible systems. Secondly, for strongly observable systems, by digesting the idea of a finite-time observer, the finite-time integration unknown input observer is designed, and the faults are estimated exactly in pre-designed arbitrary finite time. Furthermore, for strongly detectable systems, after the system decomposed into strongly observable part and nonstrongly observable part, faults are able to be reconstructed very rapidly due to the finite-time observation of the strongly observable subsystem. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and the advantage of the proposed fast fault estimation schemes. },

This article gives an overview of the main developments in the area of stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) in the past decade and provides the reader with an impression of the different SMPC algorithms and the key theoretical challenges in stochastic predictive control without undue mathematical complexity. The general formulation of a stochastic OCP is first presented, followed by an overview of SMPC approaches for linear and nonlinear systems.

  abstract      = {Summary This paper considers the robustness of a feedback connection of a known linear parameter varying system and a perturbation. A sufficient condition is derived to bound the worst-case gain and ensure robust asymptotic stability. The input/output behavior of the perturbation is described by multiple integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). The analysis condition is formulated as a dissipation inequality. The standard approach requires a non-negative definite storage function and the use of ‘hard’ IQCs. The term ‘hard’ means that the IQCs can be specified as time-domain integral constraints that hold over all finite horizons. The main result demonstrates that the dissipation inequality condition can be formulated requiring neither a non-negative storage function nor hard IQCs. A key insight used to prove this result is that the multiple IQCs, when combined, contain hidden stored energy. This result can lead to less conservative robustness bounds. Two simple examples are presented to demonstrate this fact. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The presented techniques, which are based on linear estimation and probability theory, are tailored for gas turbine engine performance estimation and gas path fault diagnostics applications. They enable quantification of the performance estimation and diagnostic accuracy offered by different candidate sensor suites. For performance estimation, sensor selection metrics are presented for two types of estimators including a Kalman filter and a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. For each type of performance estimator, sensor selection is based on minimizing the theoretical sum of squared estimation errors (SSEE) in health parameters representing performance deterioration in the major rotating modules of the engine. For gas path fault diagnostics, the sensor selection metric is set up to maximize correct classification rate (CCR) for a diagnostic strategy that performs fault classification by identifying the fault type that most closely matches the observed measurement signature in a weighted least squares sense. Results from the application of the sensor selection metrics to a linear engine model are presented and discussed. Given a baseline sensor suite and a candidate list of optional sensors, an exhaustive search is performed to determine the optimal sensor suites for performance estimation and fault diagnostics. For any given sensor suite, Monte Carlo simulation results are found to exhibit good agreement with theoretical predictions of estimation and diagnostic accuracies.}},

In this paper, we present a new method to compute time-optimal motions around a path. By employing an appropriate change of variables for the robot dynamics to path coordinates, geometric constraints enter the optimal control formulation in a convenient way.

  abstract  = {In this work, modeling and control of a time-varying nonlinear system is studied. The modeling is under the Gaussian process regression (GPR) framework, which is a data-driven approach. To address he time-varying phenomenon which commonly exists in the manufacturing processes, an online GPR algorithm is adopted. Next, model predictive control (MPC) is designed based on the obtained GPR model which aims to minimize the difference between the actual process output and the reference or target. The advantage of incorporating the GPR modeling in the MPC design is that, GPR based prediction not only gives the predicted output but also the associated prediction uncertainty. By utilizing the additional information, the tolerance for prediction uncertainty is set as one of the constrains in the MPC design. From practical point of view, the GPR based MPC design provides the opportunity for safe operation or quality control by knowing and setting the tolerance for the prediction uncertainty, which is significantly important in manufacturing process control. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are validated through simulation based studies.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces a learning-based robust control algorithm that provides robust stability and performance guarantees during learning. The approach uses Gaussian process (GP) regression based on data gathered during operation to update an initial model of the system and to gradually decrease the uncertainty related to this model. Embedding this data-based update scheme in a robust control framework guarantees stability during the learning process. Traditional robust control approaches have not considered online adaptation of the model and its uncertainty before. As a result, their controllers do not improve performance during operation. Typical machine learning algorithms that have achieved similar high-performance behavior by adapting the model and controller online do not provide the guarantees presented in this paper. In particular, this paper considers a stabilization task, linearizes the nonlinear, GP-based model around a desired operating point, and solves a convex optimization problem to obtain a linear robust controller. The resulting performance improvements due to the learning-based controller are demonstrated in experiments on a quadrotor vehicle.},

Given a region of interest in the state space, our technique uses simulation traces originating at states within this region to construct candidate {Lyapunov} functions, which are in turn used to obtain candidate forward invariant sets. To vet a candidate invariant set, our technique samples a finite number of states from the set and tests them. We derive sufficient conditions on the sample density that formally guarantee that the candidate invariant set is indeed forward invariant. Finally, we present a numerical example illustrating the efficacy of the technique. {\copyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

  abstract        = {In this paper, the problem that we are interested is constructing $$l_{1}$$l1-graphs for subspace learning via recurrent neural networks. We propose a closed affine subspace learning (CASL) method to do so. The problem of CASL is formulated as an optimization problem described by an energy function in the non-negative orthant. The sufficient conditions for keeping the minimum points of the energy function in the non-negative orthant are given. A model of Lotka–Volterra recurrent neural networks is constructed to solve the optimization problem in terms of these sufficient conditions. It shows that the set of stable attractors of the network model just equals the set of minimum points of the energy function in the non-negative orthant. Based on these equivalences, the problem of CASL can be solved by running the proposed LV RNNs to obtain the stable attractors. The $$l_{1}$$l1-graphs then can be constructed. Experiments on some synthetic and real data show that the $$l_{1}$$l1-graphs constructed in this way are more effective, especially when processing the data sampled from multiple manifolds. © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.},

  abstract      = {Robust control maintains stability and performance for a fixed amount of model uncertainty but can be conservative since the model is not updated online. Learning-based control, on the other hand, uses data to improve the model over time but is not typically guaranteed to be robust throughout the process. This paper proposes a novel combination of both ideas: a robust Min-Max Learning-Based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MM-LB-NMPC) algorithm. Based on an existing LB-NMPC algorithm, we present an efficient and robust extension, altering the NMPC performance objective to optimize for the worst-case scenario. The algorithm uses a simple a priori vehicle model and a learned disturbance model. Disturbances are modelled as a Gaussian Process (GP) based on experience collected during previous trials as a function of system state, input, and other relevant variables. Nominal state sequences are predicted using an Unscented Transform and worst-case scenarios are defined as sequences bounding the 3σ confidence region. Localization for the controller is provided by an on-board, vision-based mapping and navigation system enabling operation in large-scale, GPS-denied environments. The paper presents experimental results from testing on a 50 kg skid-steered robot executing a path-tracking task. The results show reductions in maximum lateral and heading path-tracking errors by up to 30% and a clear transition from robust control when the model uncertainty is high to optimal control when model uncertainty is reduced.},

  abstract      = {Summary A general approach is presented to analyze the worst case input/output gain for an interconnection of a linear parameter varying (LPV) system and an uncertain or nonlinear element. The LPV system is described by state matrices that have an arbitrary, that is not necessarily rational, dependence on the parameters. The input/output behavior of the nonlinear/uncertain block is described by an integral quadratic constraint (IQC). A dissipation inequality is proposed to compute an upper bound for this gain. This worst-case gain condition can be formulated as a semidefinite program and efficiently solved using available optimization software. Moreover, it is shown that this new condition is a generalization of the well-known bounded real lemma type result for LPV systems. The results contained in this paper complement known results that apply IQCs for analysis of LPV systems whose state matrices have a rational dependence on the parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on simple numerical examples. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The input/output behavior of the perturbation is described by an integral quadratic constraint (IQC). IQC stability theorems can be formulated in the frequency domain or with a time-domain dissipation inequality. The two approaches are connected by a non-unique factorization of the frequency domain IQC multiplier. The factorization must satisfy two properties for the dissipation inequality to be valid. First, the factorization must ensure the time-domain IQC holds for all finite times. Second, the factorization must ensure that a related matrix inequality, when feasible, has a positive semidefinite solution. This technical note shows that a class of frequency domain IQC multipliers has a factorization satisfying these two properties.

In this framework, an engine model is firstly developed, based upon engine design parameters and conditions using a genuine code. Next, the exergy analysis is performed according to thermodynamic laws. At the end of the study, the combustion chamber is identified as the most irreversible component of the engine, while the high pressure turbine and compressor are identified as the most efficient components throughout the flight. The minimum exergy efficiency is 58.24% for the combustion chamber at the end of the ingress flight phase, while the maximum exergy efficiency is found to be 99.09% for the high pressure turbine at the start of the ingress flight phase and landing loiter. The highest exergy destruction within the engine occurs at landing loiter, take-off and start of climb, with rates of 16998.768 kW, 16820.317 kW and 16564.378 kW respectively.},

  abstract = {Summary In this paper, robust disturbance-feedback strategies for finite time-horizon problems are studied. Linear discrete-time systems subject to linear control, state constraints, and quadratic objective functions are considered. In addition, persistent disturbances, which enter the system additively and are contained in a polytopic set, act on the system. The synthesis of robust strategies leads in the case of the traditional robust state-feedback and open-loop min--max strategies to, respectively, nonconvex problems or conservatism. However, robust disturbance-feedback problems can easily be reformulated as convex problems and solved by tractable linear matrix inequalities. Hence this approach bypasses the nonconvexity issue while maintaining the advantages of feedback strategies. As a key result, it is shown that both sources of conservatism attributed to this approach, namely, the relaxation method and the affine parametrization, can be removed at the expense of an increase in computational effort.

  abstract = {A relatively recent approach for robust Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is based on scenario trees with a so-called recourse formulation. This approach is of interest, because it is less conservative than worst-case robustification approaches. A major challenge when using scenario trees for robust NMPC is the large number of scenarios, which grows exponentially. This exponential growth quickly becomes a bottleneck for the computational costs, which need to stay within bounds that permit real-time applicability. We present how to generate scenarios based on a quadrature rule for the expectation value of an arbitrary economic objective function. The use of sparse grids for the quadrature of the high-dimensional stochastic integrals yields a drastically smaller number of scenarios than the tensor grid approaches used so far. We compare the performance of several robust NMPC approaches for a distillation column with three normally distributed uncertain parameters within a simulated Monte-Carlo controller testbed.},

This transverse contraction condition can be represented as a pointwise linear matrix inequality (LMI), thus allowing convex optimisation tools such as sum-of-squares programming to be used to search for certificates of the existence of a stable limit cycle. Many desirable properties of contracting dynamics are extended to this context, including the preservation of contraction under a broad class of interconnections. In addition, by introducing the concepts of differential dissipativity and transverse differential dissipativity, contraction and transverse contraction can be established for interconnected systems via LMI conditions on component subsystems.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a Learning-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (LB-NMPC) algorithm for an autonomous mobile robot to reduce path-tracking errors over repeated traverses along a reference path. The LB-NMPC algorithm uses a simple a priori vehicle model and a learned disturbance model. Disturbances are modelled as a Gaussian Process (GP) based on experience collected during previous traversals as a function of system state, input and other relevant variables. Modelling the disturbance as a GP enables interpolation and extrapolation of learned disturbances, a key feature of this algorithm. Localization for the controller is provided by an on-board, vision-based mapping and navigation system enabling operation in large-scale, GPS-denied environments. The paper presents experimental results including over 1.8 km of travel by a four-wheeled, 50 kg robot travelling through challenging terrain (including steep, uneven hills) and by a six-wheeled, 160 kg robot learning disturbances caused by unmodelled dynamics at speeds ranging from 0.35 m/s to 1.0 m/s. The speed is scheduled to balance trial time, path-tracking errors, and localization reliability based on previous experience. The results show that the system can start from a generic a priori vehicle model and subsequently learn to reduce vehicle- and trajectory-specific path-tracking errors based on experience.},

Two type of uncertainties are considered: constant parametric uncertainties and time-varying switching uncertainties. Results are in LMI formalism and proofs involve parameter-dependent, quadratic in the state, Lyapunov functions. The new proposed conditions are shown to extend and merge two important existing results. Conservatism reduction is tackled via a model augmentation technique. Numerical complexity is contained by exploiting the structure of the models with respect to the uncertainties.},

  abstract      = {Controller design faces a trade-off between robustness and performance, and the reliability of linear controllers has caused many practitioners to focus on the former. However, there is renewed interest in improving system performance to deal with growing energy constraints. This paper describes a learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) scheme that provides deterministic guarantees on robustness, while statistical identification tools are used to identify richer models of the system in order to improve performance; the benefits of this framework are that it handles state and input constraints, optimizes system performance with respect to a cost function, and can be designed to use a wide variety of parametric or nonparametric statistical tools. The main insight of LBMPC is that safety and performance can be decoupled under reasonable conditions in an optimization framework by maintaining two models of the system. The first is an approximate model with bounds on its uncertainty, and the second model is updated by statistical methods. LBMPC improves performance by choosing inputs that minimize a cost subject to the learned dynamics, and it ensures safety and robustness by checking whether these same inputs keep the approximate model stable when it is subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, we show that if the system is sufficiently excited, then the LBMPC control action probabilistically converges to that of an MPC computed using the true dynamics.},

First, we can see that the stability properties of nonnegative equilibria for the weakly coupled reaction-diffusion system are similar to that for the corresponding ODE system, that is, linear self-diffusions do not drive instability. Second, using Sobolev embedding theorems and bootstrap arguments, the existence and uniqueness of nonnegative global classical solution for the strongly coupled cross-diffusion system are proved when the space dimension is less than 10. Finally, the existence and uniform boundedness of global solutions and the stability of the positive equilibrium point for the cross-diffusion system are studied when the space dimension is one. It is found that the cross-diffusion system is dissipative if the diffusion matrix is positive definite. Furthermore, cross diffusions cannot induce pattern formation if the linear diffusion rates are sufficiently large. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Efficient allocating the sacred physical resources among multiple virtual networks requests is a major challenge. Current resource allocation studies mainly focus on developing mapping algorithm with the model of one physical network and one virtual network. In this paper, we introduce a Lotka-Volterra model based resource allocation algorithm, consisting of multiple virtual networks. We apply the Lotka- Volterra model, which is a mathematical population model of bio-inspired species competition approach, to implement distributing resources for virtual networks. And Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm enhances the performance of the revenue-cost ratio and revenue of the embedding problem.},

Firstly, based on the MSFs method, a sufficient condition for the existence of the passivity of the underlying system is established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Furthermore, the problem of dynamic output feedback passive control is investigated. Based on the obtained passivity condition, a sufficient condition for the existence of the desired switched passive controller is derived. Finally, a numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. {\copyright} 2013 Huimei Jia et al.},

  abstract = {Many biaxial contouring systems involve competing control objectives of maximizing accuracy while minimizing traversal time. A model predictive controller for contouring systems is proposed where the control inputs are determined by minimizing a cost function which reflects the tradeoff between these competing objectives, subject to state and actuator constraints. The path speed is automatically adjusted to maintain accuracy along the path, and the cost function can be tuned towards higher contouring accuracy and lower path speed, or vice versa. To facilitate real-time implementation, a linear time-varying approach is proposed. The controller is successfully implemented in real time on an X-Y table, and experimental results demonstrate that the new contouring control scheme achieves an improvement in performance compared to both industry standard and advanced tracking controllers.},

  abstract = {The control of a Rotary Inverted Pendulum (RIP) is a well-known and a challenging problem that serves as a popular benchmark in modern control system studies. The task is to design controllers which drives the pendulum from its hanging-down position to the upright position and then hold it there. The swing up is achieved using an energy based controller. In energy based control the pendulum is controlled in such a way that its energy is driven towards a value equal to the steady-state upright position. Then a mode controller switches between the swing-up controller and stabilizing controller near the upright position. For stabilization control, two control techniques are analyzed. Firstly, a sliding mode controller (SMC) is designed to stabilize the pendulum. Secondly, a state feedback controller is designed that would maintain the pendulum upright and handle disturbances up to a certain point. The state feedback controller is designed using the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). The responses of the LQR controller and SMC controller are compared in simulation.},

First, it is shown that, if the inertia matrix is constant, constant disturbances (both, matched and unmatched) can be rejected simply adding a suitable integral action—interestingly, not at the passive output. For systems with non-constant inertia matrix, additional damping and gyroscopic forces terms must be added to reject matched disturbances and, moreover, enforce the property of integral input-to-state stability with respect to matched disturbances. The stronger property of input-to-state stability, this time with respect to matched and unmatched disturbances, is ensured with further addition of nonlinear damping. Finally, it is shown that including a partial change of coordinates, the controller can be significantly simplified, preserving input-to-state stability with respect to matched disturbances.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents LMI conditions for local, regional, and global robust asymptotic stability of rational uncertain nonlinear systems. The uncertainties are modeled as real time varying parameters with magnitude and rate of variation bounded by given polytopes and the system vector field is a rational function of the states and uncertain parameters. Sufficient LMI conditions for asymptotic stability of the origin are given through a rational {Lyapunov} function of the states and uncertain parameters. The case where the time derivative of the {Lyapunov} function is negative semidefinite is also considered and connections with the well known LaSalle's invariance conditions are established. In regional stability problems, an algorithm to maximize the estimate of the region of attraction is proposed. The algorithm consists of maximizing the estimate for a given target region of initial states. The size and shape of the target region are recursively modified in the directions where the estimate can be enlarged. The target region can be taken as a polytope (convex set) or union of polytopes (non-convex set). The estimates of the region of attraction are robust with respect to the uncertain parameters and their rate of change. The case of global and orthant stability problems are also considered. Connections with some results found in sum of squares based methods and other related methods found in the literature are established. The LMIs in this paper are obtained by using the Finsler's Lemma and the notion of annihilators. The LMIs are characterized by affine functions of the state and uncertain parameters, and they are tested at the vertices of a polytopic region. It is also shown that, with some additional conservatism, the use of the vertices can be avoided by modifying the LMIs with the S-Procedure. Several numerical examples found in the literature are used to compare the results and illustrate the advantages of the proposed method. Copyright {\copyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates stochastic stabilization procedures based on quadratic and piecewise linear Lyapunov functions for discrete-time linear systems affected by multiplicative disturbances and subject to linear constraints on inputs and states. A stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) design approach is proposed to optimize closed-loop performance while enforcing constraints. Conditions for stochastic convergence and robust constraints fulfillment of the closed-loop system are enforced by solving linear matrix inequality problems off line. Performance is optimized on line using multistage stochastic optimization based on enumeration of scenarios, that amounts to solving a quadratic program subject to either quadratic or linear constraints. In the latter case, an explicit form is computable to ease the implementation of the proposed SMPC law. The approach can deal with a very general class of stochastic disturbance processes with discrete probability distribution. The effectiveness of the proposed SMPC formulation is shown on a numerical example and compared to traditional MPC schemes.},

Theory for stability analysis and design for a class of observer-based feedback control systems is presented. A circle-criterion approach can be used to design an observer-based state feedback control which yields a closed-loop system with specified robustness characteristics. The approach is relevant for variable structure system design with preservation of stability when switching feedback control or sliding mode control is introduced in the feedback loop. It is shown that there exists a {Lyapunov} function valid over the total operating range and this {Lyapunov} function has also interpretation as a storage function of passivity-based control. The {Lyapunov} function can be found by solving a {Lyapunov} equation, which also generates variable structure switching surfaces. Important applications are to be found in variable structure systems with high robustness requirements.},

In stark contrast with existing approaches that are confined to memoryless static controller synthesis, we explore dynamical controller synthesis and reveal a particular periodically time-varying memory state-feedback controller (PTVMSFC) structure that allows LMI-based synthesis. In the context of robust controller synthesis, we prove rigorously that the proposed design method encompasses the well-known extended-LMI-based static controller synthesis methods as particular cases. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the suggested design method is indeed effective in achieving less conservative results, under both periodic and time-invariant settings. We finally derive a viable test to verify that the designed robust PTVMSFC is {\textquotedblleft}exact{\textquotedblright} in the sense that it attains the best achievable robust performance. This exactness verification test works fine in practice, and we will show via a numerical example that exact robust control is indeed attained by designing PTVMSFCs, even for such a problem where the standard memoryless static state-feedback fails.},

Similarity state transformations between equivalent State-Space (SS) representations of discrete-time Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems are investigated. Based on previous results, it is known that to characterize all equivalent LPV-SS representations, the state-transformation matrix must depend dynamically on the scheduling variable. However, preserving static dependence of a LPV-SS representation, i.e. characterizing all equivalent SS representation with static dependence, has primary importance both in control and identification. Therefore, first, the state transformation problem is investigated from an algebraic (behavior) point of view, then conditions are developed to guarantee preservation of the static dependence in similarity state transformations. Additional geometric interpretation of the obtained results, together with computational approach to synthesize state-transformations are also developed. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the validity of the obtained results.},

This paper presents an algorithm for computing inner estimates of the regions of attraction of limit cycles of a nonlinear hybrid system.

The construction of the transverse dynamics is novel, and valid for a broad class of nonlinear hybrid systems.},

This paper illustrates the application of recent research in region-of-attraction analysis for nonlinear hybrid limit cycles. Three example systems are analyzed in detail: the van der Pol oscillator, the “rimless wheel”, and the “compass gait”, the latter two being simplified models of underactuated walking robots. The method used involves decomposition of the dynamics about the target cycle into tangential and transverse components, and a search for a Lyapunov function in the transverse dynamics using sum-of-squares analysis (semidefinite programming). Each example illuminates different aspects of the procedure, including optimization of transversal surfaces, the handling of impact maps, optimization of the Lyapunov function, and orbitally-stabilizing control design.},

Online learning of these dynamics models allows the robot controller to adapt itself to changes in the dynamics (e.g., due to time-variant nonlinearities or unforeseen loads). However, online learning in real-time applications – as required in control – cannot be realized by straightforward usage of off-the-shelf machine learning methods such as Gaussian process regression or support vector regression. In this paper, we propose a framework for online, incremental sparsification with a fixed budget designed for fast real-time model learning. The proposed approach employs a sparsification method based on an independence measure. In combination with an incremental learning approach such as incremental Gaussian process regression, we obtain a model approximation method which is applicable in real-time online learning. It exhibits competitive learning accuracy when compared with standard regression techniques. Implementation on a real Barrett WAM robot demonstrates the applicability of the approach in real-time online model learning for real world systems.},

In this paper we generalize our previous results on the synthesis of robust controllers. A novel controller/scaling algorithm is proposed that allows for the use of arbitrary real-rational Integral Quadratic Constraint (IQC) multipliers with no poles on the extended imaginary axis. In contrast to the classical $\mu$-synthesis approaches, the techniques completely avoid gridding as well as curve-fitting. Moreover, while the classical approaches are restricted to the use of real/complex time-invariant or arbitrarily fast time-varying parametric uncertainties, the IQC framework can be employed for a much larger class of uncertainties involving nonlinearities and bounds on rates of time-varying parametric uncertainties. The results are illustrated through a numerical example.},

From the Gaussian process perspective a multioutput Mercer kernel is a covariance function over correlated output functions. One way to construct such kernels is based on convolution processes (CP). A key problem for this approach is efficient inference. Alvarez and Lawrence recently presented a sparse approximation for CPs that enabled efficient inference. In this paper, we extend this work in two directions: we introduce the concept of variational inducing functions to handle potential non-smooth functions involved in the kernel CP construction and we consider an alternative approach to approximate inference based on variational methods, extending the work by Titsias (2009) to the multiple output case. We demonstrate our approaches on prediction of school marks, compiler performance and financial time series.},

It can be seen as a generalization of semidefinite programming, since it means optimizing over the cone of so called copositive matrices. Like semidefinite programming, it has proved particularly useful in combinatorial and quadratic optimization. The purpose of this survey is to introduce the field to interested readers in the optimization community who wish to get an understanding of the basic concepts and recent developments in copositive programming, including modeling issues and applications, the connection to semidefinite programming and sum-of-squares approaches, as well as algorithmic solution approaches for copositive programs.},

In this paper, a model predictive controller for contouring systems is proposed where the control inputs are determined by minimising a cost function which reflects the trade-off between these competing objectives, subject to state and actuator constraints. To facilitate real-time implementation, a linear time-varying approach is proposed, and stability is guaranteed by introducing an additional contraction constraint. Simulation results for an XY table system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed contouring control scheme.},

  abstract  = {Integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) provide a general framework for robustness analysis of feedback inter-connections. The main IQC stability theorem by Megretski and Rantzer was formulated with frequency domain conditions that depend on the IQC multiplier. Their proof of this theorem uses a homotopy method and operator theory. An interesting aspect of this theory is that input/output stability (defined as uniformly bounded gain over all finite horizons) is established using integral constraints that only hold, in general, on infinite time horizons. The use of IQCs that only hold over infinite time horizons is related to the use of noncausal multipliers in absolute stability theory. This paper shows that if the conditions of the IQC stability theorem are satisfied by any rational IQC multiplier then a dissipation inequality is satisfied by a quadratic storage function. This provides a new interpretation for IQC analysis in terms of quadratic storage functions and a causal, finite-horizon dissipation inequality.},

  abstract  = {In this paper the design of robust Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) controllers is addressed. A novel controller/scaling algorithm based on dynamic Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs) is proposed that completely avoids gridding as well as curve-fitting. Although, in this paper, we restrict our attention to dynamic DG-scalings, the techniques allow for generalization to the use of arbitrary real-rational IQC multipliers with no poles on the extended imaginary axis. While the classical μ-synthesis approach is restricted to the use of real/complex time-invariant or arbitrarily fast time-varying parametric uncertainties, the IQC framework can be employed for a much larger class of uncertainties involving nonlinearities and bounds on rates of time-varying parametric uncertainties. Moreover, the proposed techniques have a great potential for solutions of the nominal dynamic IQC based LPV controller synthesis problem in terms of LMIs.},

Two basic approaches will be considered, these apply differential algebraic and differential geometric tools. In the differential algebraic approach the state elimination methods will be used to derive nonlinear parity relations. In the specific case when a reconstruction of the fault signal is needed the dynamic inversion based approach will be investigated. This approach will also be studied from geometric point of view. The geometric approach, as proposed by Isidori and De Persis, is suitable to extend the detection filter and unknown input observer design approaches (well elaborated for LTI systems) to affine nonlinear systems. Beyond the development of the theory of fault detection and identification it is equally important to offer computable methods and to analyze the robustness properties against uncertainties. Both the observer based and the inversion based approaches will be elaborated for LPV systems that may offer computational tools inherited from linear systems and also allow to design for robustness utilizing results from H∞ robust filtering and disturbance attenuation.},

Both hard and soft constraints are considered, and bounds are imposed on the probability of soft constraint violation. Assuming the plant parameters to be finitely supported, a method of constraint handling is proposed in which a sequence of tubes, corresponding to a sequence of confidence levels on the predicted future plant state, is constructed online around nominal state trajectories. A set of linear constraints is derived by imposing bounds on the probability of constraint violation at each point on an infinite prediction horizon through constraints on one-step-ahead predictions. A guarantee of the recursive feasibility of the online optimization ensures that the closed loop system trajectories satisfy both the hard and probabilistic soft constraints. The approach is illustrated by a numerical example.},

The (D, G) scaling has vast application area around control theory, optimization and signal processing. This is because, by applying the (D, G) scaling, we can convert inequality conditions depending on an uncertain parameter to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) in an exact fashion. However, its exactness proof is tough, and this stems from the fact that the proof requires an involved matrix formula in addition to the standard Lagrange duality theory. To streamline the proof, in the present paper, we clarify that the involved matrix formula is closely related to a norm preserving dilation under structural constraints. By providing an elementary proof for the norm preserving dilation, it follows that basic results such as Schur complement and congruence transformation in conjunction with the Lagrange duality theory are enough to complete a self-contained exactness proof.},

The design of the proposed FDI filter is based on dynamic inversion and on a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) observer design. To improve the performance properties of heavy vehicles, i.e. to reduce the risk of rollovers, improve passenger comfort and road holding, a reconfigurable fault-tolerant control design of the active suspensions and the active brake is performed. However when a fault (loss in effectiveness) occurs at one of the suspension actuators a further reconfiguration is needed in order to maintain the same performance level. The proposed reconfiguration scheme is based on an LPV method that uses the fault information as one of the scheduling variables. The LPV based control design and the operation of the control mechanism are demonstrated through a vehicle maneuver.},

  abstract        = {Robust stability of linear time-invariant systems with respect to structured uncertainties is considered. The small gain condition is sufficient to prove robust stability and scalings are typically used to reduce the conservatism of this condition. It is known that if the small gain condition is satisfied with constant scalings then there is a single quadratic {Lyapunov} function which proves robust stability with respect to all allowable time-varying perturbations. In this technical note we show that if the small gain condition is satisfied with frequency-varying scalings then an explicit parameter dependent {Lyapunov} function can be constructed to prove robust stability with respect to constant uncertainties. This {Lyapunov} function has a rational quadratic dependence on the uncertainties. {\copyright} 2009 IEEE.},

Immersion and invariance: A new tool for stabilization and adaptive control of nonlinear systems. IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 48, 590–606]. The key steps of I&I are (i) the definition of a target dynamics, whose order is strictly smaller than the order of the system to be controlled; (ii) the construction of an invariant manifold such that the restriction of the system dynamics to this manifold coincides with the target dynamics; (iii) the design of a control law that renders the manifold attractive and ensures that all signals are bounded. The second step requires the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) that may be difficult to obtain. In this short note we use the classical cart and pendulum system to show that by interlacing the first and second steps, and invoking physical considerations, it is possible to obviate the solution of the PDE. To underscore the generality of the proposed variation of I&I, we show that it is also applicable to a class of n-dimensional systems that contain, as a particular case, the cart and pendulum system.},

To derive sufficient conditions for analysing input-to-output properties, we consider polynomial {Lyapunov} functions of the state and uncertain parameters (assumed to be bounded) and a differential-algebraic representation of the nonlinear system. The analysis conditions are written in terms of linear matrix inequalities determining a bound on the {{$\mathcal{L}$}}︁2-gain of the input-to-output operator for a class of (bounded) admissible disturbance signals. Through a suitable parametrization involving the {Lyapunov} and control matrices, we also propose a linear (full-order) output feedback controller with a guaranteed bound on the {{$\mathcal{L}$}}︁2-gain. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the proposed approach. Copyright {\copyright} 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Energy production is one of the largest sources of air pollution. A feasible method to reduce the harmful flue gases emissions and to increase the efficiency is to improve the control strategies of the existing thermoelectric power plants. This makes the Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) method very suitable for achieving an efficient combustion control. Recently, an explicit approximate approach for stochastic NMPC based on a Gaussian process model was proposed. The benefits of an explicit solution, in addition to the efficient on-line computations, include also verifiability of the implementation, which is an essential issue in safety-critical applications. This paper considers the application of an explicit approximate approach for stochastic NMPC to the design of an explicit reference tracking NMPC controller for a combustion plant based on its Gaussian process model. The controller brings the air factor (respectively the concentration of oxygen in the flue gases) on its optimal value with every change of the load factor and thus an optimal operation of the combustion plant is achieved.},

  abstract  = {This paper gives an overview of the applicability of the stability analysis based on integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) using the IQCbeta toolbox in MATLAB. One main advantage of the IQC theory is the possibility to deal with different kinds of perturbations - like linear time invariant (LTI) and linear time variant (LTV) parametric uncertainties, nonlinearities and unmodelled dynamics - in one stability analysis. Before using the IQCbeta toolbox the perturbated system has to be split in a nominal LTI part and the remaining parts. This step can be performed with the LFR toolbox in MATLAB, especially for large systems. In this paper a new procedure is presented how to import objects of the LFR toolbox into the IQCbeta toolbox in a general sense. As design example a controlled two-mass-spring system with friction is taken, which serves as the model for many mechanical components in real life. The main result of this paper is the stability analysis of the presented model with respect to uncertain LTI and slowly LTV parameters and nonlinearities. The stability region of the IQC analysis is compared to the one expected by extensive simulations and worst case optimizations.},

  abstract = {Recently, the author has proposed a methodology for the design of nonlinear observers based on the dissipative theory. This methodology offers a systematic approach to the observer design providing great flexibility and generality. For example, several well known observer design methods, as the High-Gain and the Lipschitz Observers, can be treated and generalized in a unified manner by the Dissipative Approach. Moreover, different objectives in observation can be also unified and generalized by the Dissipative Approach, as for example the design of Unknown Input and Robust Observers. The objective of this paper is to show how this methodology can be applied in the design of observers for bioprocesses and its advantages for this kind of processes. An example illustrates the main ideas.},

This paper is concerned with robust stability analysis of controlled Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs) that takes into account the time-varying nature of the parameter variations as well as bounds on their rate-of-variations. First, a self-scheduled Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) current controller design for the inner rotor-side loop is presented. The design is based on viewing the mechanical angular speed as an uncertain yet online measurable parameter and on subsuming the problem into the framework of LPV controller synthesis. Then the parameter-dependent model of the machine is transform into a Linear Fractional Representation, which allows to perform a stability analysis based on a specifically chosen set of Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs). Some simulation and analysis test results are given to demonstrate the robustness margins that result with this control algorithm.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the model reduction of nonstationary linear parameter-varying (NSLPV) systems. We provide a generalization of the balanced truncation procedure for the model reduction of stable NSLPV systems, along with a priori error bounds. Then, for illustration purposes, this method is applied to reduce the model of a two-mass translational system. Furthermore, we give an approach for the model reduction of stabilizable and detectable systems, which requires the development and use of coprime factorizations for NSLPV models. For the general class of eventually periodic LPV systems, which includes periodic and finite horizon systems as special cases, our results can be explicitly computed using semidefinite programming},

  abstract  = {Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) algorithms are based on various nonlinear models. Recently, an on-line optimization approach for stochastic NMPC based on a Gaussian process model was proposed. A significant advantage of the Gaussian process models is that they provide information about prediction uncertainties, which would be of help in NMPC design. On the other hand, an explicit solution to the stochastic NMPC problem based on Gaussian process model would allow efficient on-line computations as well as verifiability of the implementation. This paper suggests an approximate multi-parametric Nonlinear Programming approach to explicit solution of stochastic NMPC problems for constrained nonlinear systems based on Gaussian process model. In particular, the reference tracking problem is considered. The approach builds an orthogonal search tree structure of the state space partition and consists in constructing a feasible PWL approximation to the optimal control sequence.},

Analysis methods are developed in terms of semidefinite programming for the computation of upper and lower bounds for the optimum robust performance level. The upper bound computation is based on an integral quadratic constraint (IQC) test developed using a generalized version of the so-called swapping lemma. The lower bound computation method employs an extended version of the power distribution theorem together with a generalized version of the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma and serves as a means to assess the conservatism of the computed upper bounds in the case of dynamic LTV perturbations. As corollaries of the underlying result for lower bound computation, it is shown for general block-diagonal uncertainty structures that thefrequency-dependent/constant D-scaling tests are exact for robust performance analysis against arbitrarily slow/fast dynamic LTV perturbations, respectively},

In case of polytopic models these conditions and the feasibility of the linear matrix inequalities (LMI) based design strongly depends on the weighting of the LTI vertex components of the polytopic model. With tensor product (TP) model transformation it is possible to decompose linear parameter-varying (LPV) models into polytopic forms in various ways and also provides the appropriate weighting functions. The objective of this paper is to use this decomposition on the the parallel-type double inverted pendulum control problem.},

  abstract      = {Polynomial control systems are control systems where the control system description is given in terms of polynomial nonlinearities. One encounters this class of control systems in a wide range of applications. In particular, in process control and systems biology, many control problems can be modeled as, transformed into, or approximated by polynomial control systems. The purpose of this paper is to give an introduction to and an overview over analysis and design of polynomial control systems using dissipation inequalities. Recent results for rather classical analysis problems, like in stability analysis, are presented as well as new results in emerging design problems, like synchronization. In particular, the analysis of the minimum phase behavior, the stability analysis of differential-algebraic systems with higher index, and the design of synchronizing feedbacks is carried out using dissipation inequalities. To ensure practical applicability, semidefinite programming and the sum of squares decomposition is used, to solve the obtained analysis and design dissipation inequalities in a numerically reliable and efficient way.},

  abstract = {A new predictive control framework for chemical processes is presented, that has a number of fundamental differences to classical MPC. Both future disturbances and future process measurements are explicitly introduced in the model prediction, while back-off prevents violation of the inequality constraints. A feedforward trajectory, used for constraint pushing, is optimized simultaneously with a linear time-varying feedback controller, used to minimize the back-off. No feedback is generated by the receding horizon implementation itself. Via several transformations, the resulting optimization problem is rendered convex. For nonlinear processes, this applies to the sub-problem in a sequential conic optimization approach. A two stage LQG approach reduces the complexity even further for large scale systems. The method is illustrated on a HDPE reactor example and compared to a LTV-MPC.},

On the basis of matrix sum-of-squares decompositions, we suggest a systematic procedure to construct a family of linear matrix inequality relaxations for computing upper bounds on the optimal value of the corresponding robust counterpart. With a novel matrix-version of Putinar's sum-of-squares representation for positive polynomials on compact semi-algebraic sets, we prove asymptotic exactness of the relaxation family under a suitable constraint qualification. If the uncertainty region is a compact polytope, we provide a new duality proof for the validity of Putinar's constraint qualification with an a priori degree bound on the polynomial certificates. Finally, we point out the consequences of our results for constructing relaxations based on the so-called full-block S-procedure, which allows to apply recently developed tests in order to computationally verify the exactness of possibly small-sized relaxations.},

Under mild assumptions, the resulting controller is an output-feedback controller. The performance of the technique is demonstrated with the van de Vusse reaction system.},

The MPC scheme that can be solved using Stochastic Programming (SP), for which several efficient solution techniques are available.

However, the non-unique LPV description of the nonlinear system is essential for the performance of the design. In this paper, two approaches to obtain LPV descriptions are presented. The objective of the approaches is to obtain a closer relationship between the LPV system and the nonlinear system, by minimizing the influence of variations in the parameters. In contrast to earlier approaches, the problem of finding an LPV description is separated from the analysis/synthesis part, resulting in a (convex) linear matrix inequality. An illustrating example indicates the potential of the approaches.},

This is a generalized representation of arbitrary rationally dependent multivariate functions in LFT-form. As applications, we develop explicit LFT-realizations of the transferfunction matrix of a linear descriptor system whose state-space matrices depend rationally on a set of uncertain parameters. The resulting descriptor LFTbased uncertainty models generally have smaller orders than those obtained by using the standard LFT-based modelling approach. An example of an uncertain vehicle model illustrates the capability of the method.},

However, more than 35 years of experience in the estimation community has shown that is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems that are almost linear on the time scale of the updates. Many of these difficulties arise from its use of linearization. To overcome this limitation, the unscented transformation (UT) was developed as a method to propagate mean and covariance information through nonlinear transformations. It is more accurate, easier to implement, and uses the same order of calculations as linearization. This paper reviews the motivation, development, use, and implications of the UT.},

This way, GNGD adapts its learning rate according to the dynamics of the input signal, with the additional adaptive term compensating for the simplifications in the derivation of NLMS. The performance of GNGD is bounded from below by the performance of the NLMS, whereas it converges in environments where NLMS diverges.

Previous works of the authors have shown that for linear systems the existence of an UIO is equivalent to the possibility of rendering the plant dissipative by output injection. In this paper it will be shown that, under some weak regularity conditions, an UIO can be constructed for nonlinear systems if an error system, build as the difference of the plant and the system with zero unknown input, can be rendered dissipative by output injection.},

  abstract = {A new method to design asymptotically stabilizing and adaptive control laws for nonlinear systems is presented. The method relies upon the notions of system immersion and manifold invariance and, in principle, does not require the knowledge of a (control) Lyapunov function. The construction of the stabilizing control laws resembles the procedure used in nonlinear regulator theory to derive the (invariant) output zeroing manifold and its friend. The method is well suited in situations where we know a stabilizing controller of a nominal reduced order model, which we would like to robustify with respect to higher order dynamics. This is achieved by designing a control law that asymptotically immerses the full system dynamics into the reduced order one. We also show that in adaptive control problems the method yields stabilizing schemes that counter the effect of the uncertain parameters adopting a robustness perspective. Our construction does not invoke certainty equivalence, nor requires a linear parameterization, furthermore, viewed from a Lyapunov perspective, it provides a procedure to add cross terms between the parameter estimates and the plant states. Finally, it is shown that the proposed approach is directly applicable to systems in feedback and feedforward form, yielding new stabilizing control laws. We illustrate the method with several academic and practical examples, including a mechanical system with flexibility modes, an electromechanical system with parasitic actuator dynamics and an adaptive nonlinearly parameterized visual servoing application.},

In order to consider passivity of the error dynamics for the observer problem, we place a conceptual input and output on the generalized error dynamics which also includes the plant, and the strictness of passivity is extended with respect to a set in which the estimation error becomes zero. Then, output feedback passivation for the error dynamics will lead to the construction of a state observer. It is also shown that a nonlinear observer is generally vulnerable to measurement disturbance, in the sense that even an arbitrarily small measurement disturbance can lead to a blowup of the error state. However, due to the passivity of the error dynamics, the proposed nonlinear injection gain can be easily modified for the observer to be robust to measurement disturbances.},

We use polynomial {Lyapunov} functions to derive stability conditions and performance criteria in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Although the use of polynomial {Lyapunov} functions is common for continuous-time systems as a way to reduce the conservatism in analysis, we point out that direct generalization of such an approach to discrete-time systems leads to intractable solutions because it results in a large number of LMIs. We introduce a novel approach to reduce the computational complexity by generalizing a result of Oliveira et. al. on robust stability analysis for discrete-time systems with parameter uncertainties. We point out that the proposed method can lead to less conservative results when compared with results using quadratic {Lyapunov} functions.},

Then, easily verifiable sufficient criteria are established for the existence of positive periodic solutions. The approach is based on the coincidence degree and the related continuation theorem as well as some priori estimates.},

  abstract = {The main objective of this work is to study the relationship between passivity and existence of UIO in the nonlinear case. This work is motivated by two facts: On the one side by the well-known relationship between passivity and robustness in control theory. On the other side the equivalence previously found by one of the authors in the linear (square) case between three concepts: existence of Unknown Input Observers (UIO), existence of a state feedback that renders the system strictly passive (SFSP), and existence of an output injection that makes the system strictly passive (OISP). We will restrict ourselves to the global study of square nonlinear systems (the number of unknown inputs is equal to the number of outputs), and assume that the system has only unknown inputs that enter linearly in the state equation. These assumptions simplify the analysis but none is essential. We will show that in the nonlinear case, under some regularity assumptions, the existence of UIO implies SFSP and OISP. But the converse is not valid in general. This means that in general existence of UIO is a stronger property than passificability, in contrast to the situation in the linear case.},

  abstract      = {The existence conditions of unknown input observers (UIO) for LTI systems are well known and several methods for its design have been proposed in the literature. Passivity is an important system property and has a central position in control theory. The possibility of rendering a system passive by feedback has been throughly studied and necessary and sufficient conditions for this have been obtained. In this paper it is shown that if a LTI system has an UIO, then it can be rendered strictly dissipative (or passive plus a squared down output) by either output injection or state feedback, if stabilizability is assumed in the last case. Furthermore, these properties are equivalent to a strong detectability property and to the possibility of obtaining an stable inverse of the system, by using only one derivative of the output. This allows an interesting and surprising characterization of the existence of UIO in system terms and sheds also some light into further properties of output injection or feedback passive systems. Lyapunov-like characterizations of these properties can also be given.},

It provides a nonlinear generalization of finite gains with respect to supremum norms and also of finite L/sup 2/ gains. It plays a central role in recursive design, coprime factorizations, controllers for nonminimum phase systems, and many other areas. In this paper, a newer notion, that of integral input-to-state stability (iISS), is studied. The notion of iISS generalizes the concept of finite gain when using an integral norm on inputs but supremum norms of states, in that sense generalizing the linear "H/sup 2/" theory. It allows one to quantify sensitivity even in the presence of certain forms of nonlinear resonance. We obtain several necessary and sufficient characterizations of the iISS property, expressed in terms of dissipation inequalities and other alternative and nontrivial characterizations.},

As a result, general necessary conditions are established for asymptotic stability of the zero equilibrium state, the instantaneous asymptotic stability domain of which can be either time-invariant or time-varying and then possibly asymptotically contractive. It is shown that the classical {Lyapunov} stability conditions including the invariance principle by LaSalle cannot be applied to the stability test as soon as the system instantaneous domain of asymptotic stability is asymptotically contractive. In order to investigate asymptotic stability of the zero state in such a case novel criteria are established. Under the criteria the total first time difference of a system {Lyapunov} function may be non-positive only and still can guarantee asymptotic stability of the zero state. The results are illustrated by examples.},

Physics Letters A, 133(7-8), 378-382), where we express the vector field of the dynamical system as a linear combination of products of powers of the variables. In practice, this transformation is possible only if the activation function is the hyperbolic tangent or the logistic sigmoid. From this quasi-monomial form, we can directly transform the system further into Lotka-Volterra equations. The resulting Lotka-Volterra system is of higher dimension than the original system, but the behavior of its first variables is equivalent to the behavior of the original neural network. We expect that this transformation will permit the application of existing techniques for the analysis of Lotka-Volterra systems to recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, our results show that Lotka-Volterra systems are universal approximators of dynamical systems, just as are continuous-time neural networks.

Mehrotra-type predictor-corrector variants are included. Analogous algorithms for the homogeneous formulation of the standard SDP are also implemented. Four types of search directions are available, namely, the AHO, HKM, NT, and GT directions. A few classes of SDP problems are included as well. Numerical results for these classes show that our algorithms are fairly efficient and robust on problems with dimensions of the order of a hundred. },

We define a comprehensive class of LMIs and consider a general synthesis problem described by any LMI of the class. We show a procedure that reduces the synthesis problem, which is a BMI problem, to solving a certain LMI. The derived LMI condition is equivalent to the original BMI condition and also gives a convex parametrization of all the controllers that solve the synthesis problem. The class contains many of widely-known LMIs (for H∞ norm, H2 norm, etc.), and hence the solution of this paper unifies design methods that have been proposed depending on each LMI. Further, the class also provides LMIs for multi-objective performance measures, which enable a new formulation of controller design through convex optimization. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The problem of passivity analysis finds important applications in many signal processing systems such as digital quantizers, decision feedback equalizers, and digital and analog filters. Equally important is the problem of passification, where a compensator needs to be designed for a given system to become passive. This paper considers these two problems for a large class of systems that involve uncertain parameters, time delays, quantization errors, and unmodeled high-order dynamics. By characterizing these and many other types of uncertainty using a general tool called integral quadratic constraints (IQCs), we present solutions to the problems of robust passivity analysis and robust passification. More specifically, for the analysis problem, we determine if a given uncertain system is passive for all admissible uncertainty satisfying the IQCs. Similarly, for the problem of robust passification, we are concerned with finding a loop transformation such that a particular part of the uncertain signal processing system becomes passive for all admissible uncertainty. The solutions are given in terms of the feasibility of one or more linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be solved efficiently.},

We discuss here the algebraic properties of the GLV family, such as the invariance under quasimonomial transformations and the underlying structure of classes of equivalence. Each class possesses a unique representative under the classical quadratic Lotka-Volterra form. We show how other standard modeling forms of biological interest, such as S-systems or mass-action systems, are naturally embedded into the GLV form, which thus provides a formal framework for their comparison and for the establishment of transformation rules. We also focus on the issue of recasting of general nonlinear systems into the GLV format. We present a procedure for doing so and point at possible sources of ambiguity that could make the resulting Lotka-Volterra system dependent on the path followed. We then provide some general theorems that define the operational and algorithmic framework in which this is not the case.},

In this LFR, the system is viewed as an LTI system, connected with a diagonal feedback element linear in the state. We devise an algorithm for computing LFRs. Based on this construction, we give sufficient conditions for various properties to hold for the open-loop system. These include checking whether a given polytope is stable, finding a lower bound on the decay rate of trajectories initiating in this polytope, computing an upper bound on the L2 gain, etc. All these conditions are obtained by analyzing the properties of a differential inclusion related to the LFR, and given as convex optimization problems over linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). We show how to use this approach for static state-feedback synthesis. We then generalize the results to dynamic output-feedback synthesis, in the case when f and g are linear in every state coordinate that is not measured. Extensions towards a class of nonrational and uncertain nonliner systems are discussed.},

These tests are extensions of the notions of quadratic stability and performance where the fixed quadratic Lyapunov function is replaced by a Lyapunov function with affine dependence on the uncertain parameters. Admittedly with some conservatism, the construction of such parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions can be reduced to a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem and hence is numerically tractable. These LMI-based tests are applicable to constant or time-varying uncertain parameters and are less conservative than quadratic stability in the case of slow parametric variations. They also avoid the frequency sweep needed in real-/spl mu/ analysis, and numerical experiments indicate that they often compare favorably with /spl mu/ analysis for time-invariant parameter uncertainty.},

  abstract = {An important class of linear time-varying systems consists of plants where the state-space matrices are fixed functions of some time-varying physical parameters /spl theta/. Small gain techniques can be applied to such systems to derive robust time-invariant controllers. Yet, this approach is often overly conservative when the parameters /spl theta/ undergo large variations during system operation. In general, higher performance can be achieved by control laws that incorporate available measurements of /spl theta/ and therefore "adjust" to the current plant dynamics. This paper discusses extensions of H/sub /spl infin// synthesis techniques to allow for controller dependence on time-varying but measured parameters. When this dependence is linear fractional, the existence of such gain-scheduled H/sub /spl infin// controllers is fully characterized in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The underlying synthesis problem is therefore a convex program for which efficient optimization techniques are available. The formalism and derivation techniques developed here apply to both the continuous- and discrete-time problems. Existence conditions for robust time-invariant controllers are recovered as a special case, and extensions to gain-scheduling in the face of parametric uncertainty are discussed.

Since the lowest number of intermediates has the highest priority in this characterization and since it has already been shown that three-component systems can have a Hopf bifurcation [1], the smallest reaction system must contain three intermediates. On the basis of a sufficient condition for a Hopf bifurcation in three-dimensional systems it is possible to find one reaction system which is according to the given characterization, the smallest one. In the first part of this paper it is shortly pictured and in the second part a more extensive proof that this system is really the searched smallest one is given.},

A new stability criterion is derived, based on integral quadratic constraints in the frequency domain. The new stability criterion interpolates between well known robust stability results, which are obtained in the limit. As the derivative bounds tend to zero, the new criterion turns into the usual upper bound for the structured singular value. The stability analysis, which involves a search for suitable multipliers, can be formulated as a convex optimization problem in terms of linear matrix inequalities.<>},

This is the issue of global identifiability. In this contribution we show how global identifiability for an arbitrary model structure (basically with analytic non-linearities) can be analyzed using concepts and algorithms from differential algebra. It is shown how the question of global structural identifiability is reduced to the question of whether the given model structure can be rearranged as a linear regression. An explicit algorithm to test this is also given. Furthermore, the question of ‘persistent excitation’ for the input can also be tested explicitly is a similar fashion. The algorithms involved are very well suited for implementation in computer algebra. One such implementation is also described.},

Using this method, an extensive investigation is performed for polynomials of the first degree, which allow a classification of the integrals in three families. For some systems possessing one invariant it is possible to find a second invariant using rescaling methods. They represent very restrictive solutions, implying that there exists a great number of conditions among the equation's coefficients to satisfy. A proof is given that the Volterra invariants can be deduced as a limit. Finally, the interesting properties of the solutions of these systems are studied in detail. © 1992 American Institute of Physics.},

In the process, we give a simple proof that stabilizability and detectability are sufficient to ensure the existence of such solutions.

Then, we prove that weakly minimum phase nonlinear systems having relative degree 1 can be globally asymptotically stabilized by smooth state feedback, provided that suitable controllability-like rank conditions are satisfied.

Samples of exactly and completely integrable wave and evolution equations are considered in detail, including the generalized (periodic and finite nonperiodic) Toda lattice, nonlinear Schrödinger, Korteweg-de Vries, Lotka-Volterra equations, etc.). For exactly integrable systems, the general solutions of the Cauchy and Goursat problems are given in an explicit form, while for completely integrable systems an effective method for the construction of their soliton solutions is developed. Application of the developed methods to a differential geometry problem of the classification of integrable manifolds embeddings is discussed. Supersymmetric extensions are constructed for exactly integrable systems. Using an example of the generalized Toda lattice, a quantization scheme is developed. It includes an explicit derivation of the corresponding Heisenberg operators and their description in terms of Hopf-type quantum algebras. Among multidimensional systems, the four-dimensional self-dual Yang-Mills equations are investigated with the aim of constructing their general solutions. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

This includes the important question of testing for irreducibility. A probabilistic reduction from multivariate to bivariate polynomials is given, over an arbitrary (effectively computable) field. It uses an expected number of field operations (and certain random choices) that is polynomial in the length of a computation by which the input polynomial is presented, and the degree of the polynomial. Over algebraic number fields and over finite fields, we obtain polynomial-time probabilistic algorithms. They are based on an effective version of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem.},

The traditional approach to such systems is to separate the state equations from the algebraic equations. However, such algorithms usually destroy the natural, physically-based sparsity and structure of the original system. Therefore, we consider descriptor systems in their original form. Such systems possess numerous properties not shared by the well-known state variable systems. First, we relate classical theories of matrix pencils to the solvability of descriptor systems. Then we extend the concepts of reachability, controllability, and observability of state variable systems to descriptor systems, and describe the set of reachable states for descriptor systems.},

  abstract = {Experimental evidence is presented for chaotic type non-periodic motions of a deterministic magnetoelastic oscillator. These motions are analogous to solutions in non-linear dynamic systems possessing what have been called “strange attractors”. In the experiments described below a ferromagnetic beam buckled between two magnets undergoes forced oscillations. Although the applied force is sinusoidal, nevertheless bounded, non-periodic, apparently chaotic motions result due to jumps between two or three stable equilibrium positions. A frequency analysis of the motion shows a broad spectrum of frequencies below the driving frequency. Also the distribution of zero crossing times shows a broad spectrum of times greater than the forcing period. The driving amplitude and frequency parameters required for these non-periodic motions are determined experimentally. A continuum model based on linear elastic and non-linear magnetic forces is developed and it is shown that this can be reduced to a single degree of freedom oscillator which exhibits chaotic solutions very similar to those observed experimentally. Thus, both experimental and theoretical evidence for the existence of a strange attractor in a deterministic dynamical system is presented.},

  abstract = {This paper studies a general form of sets of equations that is often the product of problem formulation in large-scale systems, especially when the equations are expressed in terms of the natural describing variables of the system. Such equations represent a broad class of time-evolutionary phenomena, and include as special cases ordinary static equations of arbitrary dimension, ordinary state-space equations, combinations of static and dynamic equations, and noncausal systems. The main thrust of the paper is to show (for sets of linear equations) that familiar concepts of dynamic system theory can be extended to this more general class, although sometimes with significant modification. Two new (and essentially dual) concepts, that of solvable and conditionable sets of equations, are found to be fundamental to the study of equations of this form. The notion of initial conditions, although not directly related to a state, is used as a general solution method for equations of this type. In addition a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a set of dynamic equations to contain an embedded state-space representation is derived.},

  abstract = {The first part of this two-part paper presents a general theory of dissipative dynamical systems. The mathematical model used is a state space model and dissipativeness is defined in terms of an inequality involving the storage function and the supply function. It is shown that the storage function satisfies an a priori inequality: it is bounded from below by the available storage and from above by the required supply. The available storage is the amount of internal storage which may be recovered from the system and the required supply is the amount of supply which has to be delivered to the system in order to transfer it from the state of minimum storage to a given state. These functions are themselves possible storage functions, i.e., they satisfy the dissipation inequality. Moreover, since the class of possible storage functions forms a convex set, there is thus a continuum of possible storage functions ranging from its lower bound, the available storage, to its upper bound, the required supply. The paper then considers interconnected systems. It is shown that dissipative systems which are interconnected via a neutral interconnection constraint define a new dissipative dynamical system and that the sum of the storage functions of the individual subsystems is a storage function for the interconnected system. The stability of dissipative systems is then investigated and it is shown that a point in the state space where the storage function attains a local minimum defines a stable equilibrium and that the storage function is a Lyapunov function for this equilibrium. These results are then applied to several examples. These concepts and results will be applied to linear dynamical systems with quadratic supply rates in the second part of this paper.},
